/**
 * Every label `.github/dependabot.yml` asks for must exist in the repository.
 *
 * Dependabot does not create a label named under an explicit `labels:` key.
 * It creates its own defaults only when that key is ABSENT — which is why
 * `javascript` exists here and `npm` did not: adding `labels:` to control the
 * labelling silently disabled it. A name with no label behind it is dropped,
 * the pull request opens anyway, and Dependabot posts a configuration-error
 * comment instead. Measured 2026-09-22 on the group PR #265, where
 * "The following labels could not be found: `npm`" had been repeating since
 * 2026-09-21 (#299).
 *
 * WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A UNIT TEST. `supply-chain.test.ts` reads this same
 * file and asserts its ecosystems, its `target-branch`, its groups and its
 * ignore rules — every claim the file's own bytes can answer. `labels:` is
 * the one entry whose truth lives OUTSIDE the file, in repository state, so
 * no amount of reading the config can judge it. This runs where a token is.
 *
 * It runs inside `build-and-test`, which is in
 * `required_status_checks.contexts`. A new job would not be a gate until that
 * list named it, and that list is repository administration (#33).
 *
 * The API call goes through `gh`, never a token this process handles: on a
 * developer's machine `gh` is routed to the `shyden-agent` App, and on a
 * runner it reads `GH_TOKEN` from the step. Either way no credential is
 * read, passed or logged here.
