/**
 * Points git at the version-controlled hooks in `.githooks/`.
 *
 * Run by `prepare`, so a fresh clone gets the pre-push hook from its first
 * `npm install` — a hook only one machine has is not a control.
 *
 * No hook runner. husky is the usual answer and it is a new dependency, which
 * this repo does not take (a new npm package is an operator decision; see CLAUDE.md);
 * `core.hooksPath` is built into git and needs nothing installed. That also
 * keeps `prepare` running only THIS file, which is three lines of our own code
 * visible in the diff, rather than a third party's postinstall — the line #39
 * drew when it made install-time code execution an explicit allowlist.
 *
 * EVERY EFFECT IS INSIDE `main()`, reached only under `import.meta.main`
 * (#276). Until then this file did its work at module scope, so importing it
 * — from a test, or from anything that wanted to read `HOOKS` — reconfigured
 * git and could exit the importing process.
