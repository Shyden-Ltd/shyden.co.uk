/**
 * Read every translated locale back into English and write the review. #95.
 *
 *   BACK_TRANSLATE_URL=http://localhost:5000 npm run i18n:back-translate
 *
 * The engine is LibreTranslate, which `.github/workflows/back-translation.yml`
 * runs beside the job; locally, the same image does it:
 *
 *   docker run -p 5000:5000 -e LT_LOAD_ONLY=en,id,zh,vi,th libretranslate/libretranslate
 *
 * Environment:
 *
 *   BACK_TRANSLATE_URL      the engine's address. Required: without it the
 *                           run fails, rather than comparing nothing.
 *   BACK_TRANSLATE_API_KEY  only for an engine that asks for one.
 *   BACK_TRANSLATE_ENGINE   the engine's name for the review, e.g. its image.
 *   BACK_TRANSLATE_REPORT   a path to write every comparison to, as JSON.
 *   GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY     where the review goes in CI; printed otherwise.
 *
 * ADVISORY: a low score never fails the run (operator decision 2026-09-10).
 * It exits 1 only when the run cannot be believed -- no engine, an engine
 * that refused or cannot read a locale, or a locale that compared nothing --
 * because a gate that silently reads nothing reports the same as one that
 * found nothing wrong.
 *
 * The decisions live in `src/lib/i18n/back-translate.ts`, unit-tested without
 * an engine. This file is wiring: read, fetch, write. Node 24 strips
 * TypeScript natively, so the catalogues import directly with no build step.
