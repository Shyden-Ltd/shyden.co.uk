/**
 * Whether an evidence page's stored sign-off lets its ticket merge (#197).
 *
 * #188's approval was given on 12 journeys and kept reading "approved" after
 * the page was republished with a 13th. Reading the stored `verdict` by eye
 * before a merge cannot see that, and neither can `updatedAt`, which a write
 * that changed nothing moves too. This runs the page's own comparison
 * (`evidence-signoff.mjs`) over the page AS PUBLISHED and its stored sign-off:
 *
 *   Artifact      read, url=<page>, path=index.html   -> the page, saved locally
 *   ArtifactData  get, collection=signoff, doc_id=<ticket>, out_dir=<dir>
 *   node scripts/signoff-status.mjs <page.html> <dir>/signoff/<ticket>.json
 *
 * It prints one line and exits 0 only for an approval that covers exactly the
 * journeys the published page shows; any other verdict exits 1. A check that
 * cannot read its inputs gives no verdict at all: it exits 2.
