/**
 * Student details: the roster table.
 *
 * ONE renderer, two CSS layouts (design spec section 3, "The roster is a
 * table on a laptop and cards on a phone"). `renderRoster` below builds a
 * single `<table>` whose `<tr class="cg-student">` rows are, structurally,
 * the same elements Stage 3, Task 3's own CSS
 * (ClassroomGroupsPage.astro's `<style is:global>` block, anchored on
 * `#cg-roster`) turns into cards below ~600px purely with `display: block`
 * on the table parts under a media query — no second render path. If a
 * future change needs a second DOM shape for the card layout, stop: that is
 * exactly the drift F-03/F-04 (design spec section 13, "same content", "same
 * behaviour") exist to catch, because two renderers can each pass their own
 * tests while quietly disagreeing with each other.
 *
 * Pure DOM building and event wiring: every render is a function of the
 * `roster` array handed to it (the plan's own Architecture note), and every
 * user edit is reported upward through `handlers` rather than mutating
 * anything here. `classroom-groups.ts` is what owns the roster array (across
 * renders) and decides when to call this again — see that file's own
 * "── student roster" section. The one exception is `renderRoster`'s own
 * `liveRoster`, which does not survive past the render call that creates
 * it and exists only to fix a same-render staleness bug — see its own
 * comment, just above the `tbody` it feeds, for what it fixes and why.
 *
 * `textContent`/`.value`/`document.createElement` throughout, never
 * `innerHTML` with anything interpolated — a teacher's typed name is
 * theirs, not markup, the same rule the results grid already follows
 * (`classroom-groups.ts`'s own `render()`, `who.textContent = label(student)`).

  // Visually hidden (`.cg-roster-remove-heading`, ClassroomGroupsPage.astro
  // -- the SAME clip-based technique #cg-roster thead's own rule already
  // uses, just applied to one cell's own content rather than a whole row,
  // and UNCONDITIONALLY rather than only below the table breakpoint):
  // showing "Remove" as a visible heading above a column of seven
  // identical "Remove" buttons would only repeat what every row already
  // says, the same judgement call this repo already made once for the
  // whole header row on the card layout. The `<th>` element ITSELF stays
  // an ordinary, unhidden table cell — only its inner span is clipped —
  // because an absolutely-positioned `<th>` risks being pulled out of the
  // header ROW's own layout in table mode, where the other six headers
  // really are visible; hiding the CONTENT instead of the CELL sidesteps
  // that risk entirely.
  //
  // Reuses `t.rosterRemove` -- the exact word every row's own button
  // already carries -- rather than a second, independent string: one word
  // for the column, the same word for the control inside it, matching the
  // doubling-as-accessible-name convention the other six headers already
  // keep (see this function's own header comment, above the `heading`
  // loop just above).

  // Bug found while adding Stage 3, Task 3's own "editing every field
  // works" test (task-3-brief.md's own Step 1, verbatim): every row below
  // is built ONCE, here, and every field's own `patched()` call (buildRow)
  // used to close directly over THIS render's `roster` array. `onTextChange`
  // (number/name) deliberately never re-renders -- see `RosterHandlers`'
  // own doc comment, "avoiding focus/caret theft" -- so that closure went
  // stale the instant a text edit landed, and the NEXT `change` event on
  // ANY row (even a different one -- every row built in this same call
  // shared the identical stale reference) computed ITS OWN patch from that
  // same stale array, silently reverting every pending text edit back to
  // what it was when this render began. Reproduced plainly: fill a name,
  // then pick a sex -- the name reverted to empty, in BOTH the card and the
  // table layout, proving it was never a layout bug at all.
  //
  // `liveRoster` is the one place both wrapped handlers below keep current,
  // and `getRoster` -- handed to every row via `buildRow`'s own parameter
  // of the same name -- is what lets a field built in an EARLIER row still
  // read the LATEST edit, made in a later one or in itself moments before,
  // rather than the snapshot this render started with. `RosterHandlers`
  // itself is untouched: `classroom-groups.ts` still receives exactly the
  // `next: Student[]` it always did, from exactly the same two callbacks --
  // this is internal bookkeeping, not a change to the public contract.
