/**
 * The Import / export section's body.
 *
 * Same shape as `roster-ui.ts`: this file builds DOM and reports upward
 * through `handlers`; `classroom-groups.ts` owns the roster and decides
 * what to do with what a teacher chose. Nothing here reads or writes the
 * roster directly.
 *
 * `textContent`/`document.createElement` throughout, never `innerHTML` with
 * anything interpolated — a file's contents and a class name are a
 * teacher's text, not markup, and this section renders both.
 *
 * PRIVACY (design spec section 9, and the promise the page makes in both
 * languages): a download is a `Blob` and an object URL that is revoked the
 * moment the click is dispatched. Nothing here writes to `localStorage`,
 * `sessionStorage`, a cookie or the address bar, and
 * classroom-groups-privacy.spec.ts asserts exactly that after each
 * operation.
