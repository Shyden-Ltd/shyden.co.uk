/**
 * The DOM-building this page's sections share.

 * `roster-ui.ts` and `io-ui.ts` each held a character-identical `button`

 * properties (#277). All four carried the same reason for `type = 'button'`,
 * one of them spelling it out in a comment and the others not — four places
 * to remember a rule that only has to be wrong once.

/**
 * A button with its text and class, never a submit.
 *
 * `type` matters and is the whole reason this is a helper rather than three
 * lines at each call site: every one of these controls sits inside
 * `#cg-form`, and a `<button>` with no type IS a submit button — clicking
 * "Download template" would shuffle the class.
 *
 * `doc` is a parameter because `renderProjector` takes the document it
 * builds into rather than reaching for the global, and a helper that reached
 * for the global would quietly remove that.
