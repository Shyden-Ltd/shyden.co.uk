/**
 * Student avatars (design spec section 5, "Avatars").
 *
 * Direction C — friendly faces, Bold strength. Three fixed faces, chosen by
 * `sex` ('M' | 'F' | null — neutral, the roster's own default), never by the
 * student's number: identity is carried by the name text next to the
 * avatar (classroom-groups.ts's own `who.textContent = label(student)`),
 * not by the avatar's appearance, so the same sex always draws the same
 * face — deterministic across every shuffle, because `Student.sex` does not
 * change when a roster is reshuffled and this module never reads anything
 * else.
 *
 * TWO signals, not one: colour AND hair length (short / medium / long)
 * both differ, so the distinction survives a greyscale printout and the
 * roughly 1 in 12 males with red-green colour blindness, for whom this
 * palette puts pink beside green (design spec's own wording). Neither is
 * "simplified" away.
 *
 * `avatarSvg` returns ONE `<symbol>` — hand-authored, once per sex — meant
 * to be referenced by `<use>` wherever it is rendered:
 * `ClassroomGroupsPage.astro` builds the three, once, statically, at build
 * time (`AVATAR_SEXES.map(avatarSvg).join('')`, injected via `set:html`
 * into a visually-hidden sprite `<svg>`); `classroom-groups.ts`'s own
 * `render()` then instantiates one small `<svg><use href="#…"></use></svg>`
 * per student. However many students appear — up to `MAX_STUDENTS` — the
 * page never carries more than three real avatar DEFINITIONS.
 *
 * SECURITY: exactly like the `AVATAR_SVG` constant this replaces, nothing a
 * teacher types is ever able to reach this template. `sex` is normalised to
 * one of three fixed keys (`normalise`, below) before anything is read from
 * a lookup table, so even a caller that ignores the TypeScript type — this
 * repo runs no type checker, in CI or anywhere else — cannot make this
 * function emit anything other than one of the three fixed strings below.
 * See `avatars.test.ts`'s own "cannot be hijacked" test, which calls this
 * with a value the type forbids and checks the result is unchanged.
