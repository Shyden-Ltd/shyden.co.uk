 * data, not a fact of the page: next-number assignment, the counts the
 * Student details header (`sectionState`, src/lib/sections.ts) reads, and
 * the one string that says whether two rosters would group differently.
 * Kept pure and here, per this repo's working agreement (CLAUDE.md: logic
 * is pure in src/lib and unit-tested; page scripts only wire the DOM), so
