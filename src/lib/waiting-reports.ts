/**
 * The waiting-reports count (#349): how many translation reports wait in the
 * production `reports` table, read from Cloudflare's D1 API and told to the
 * operator as at most one count a day, on one issue, on days any wait.
 *
 * Pure: every function here works from its arguments alone, and returns a
 * value or throws. `scripts/waiting-reports.mjs` does the fetching. Node runs
 * this file by stripping its types, with no build step, so it uses erasable
 * TypeScript only (no enums, namespaces or parameter properties), and imports
 * only `is-record.ts`, which imports nothing, by its full name.
 *
 * Anything this cannot read as a count is an error, never a zero: a zero
 * sends nothing, so a misread zero would silence the notice with no one the
 * wiser.
