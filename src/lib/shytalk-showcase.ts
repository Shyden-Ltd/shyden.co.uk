/**
 * Geometry for the ShyTalk showcase device frame on the homepage.
 *
 * One home for the numbers, because three consumers need to agree and none
 * of them can see the others: the Astro component's frame CSS, the capture
 * pass that produces the PNGs, and the guard that refuses a capture which is
 * the wrong size. Restating a measured value in a second place is how the
 * `:lang(th)` line-height was silently undone (#17).
 *
 * The aspect is not chosen, it is DERIVED from the capture device so nothing
 * is letterboxed or cropped: the OnePlus CPH2653 renders 1440x3168, which is
 * 1:2.2. `CSS_HEIGHT` is `CSS_WIDTH / (1440 / 3168)` rounded to an integer.
 *
 * `SCALE` 2 is the ticket's "sized for the frame at 2x and no larger"
 * (#138). Larger is not free: the site shipped ZERO content rasters before
 * this, so every byte here is a new cost on a page that had none. Only ONE
 * capture is ever served to a given visitor -- the one matching their
 * locale -- so the per-visit cost is one image, not five.
