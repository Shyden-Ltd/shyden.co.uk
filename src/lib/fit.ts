/**
 * How much to shrink the projected sheet so it fits the board — and whether
 * it still will not, so the caller knows it must offer a way to reach what
 * did not.
 *
 * PURE, and that is the whole point. The projector's own sizing is a
 * measure-adjust-remeasure cycle against a real box: none of the decisions
 * inside it are observable from outside, so the one decision that matters --
 * the FLOOR, below which text stops being readable from the back of a
 * room -- would be untestable if it lived in there with them.
 *
 * Returns an object rather than a number because `scrolls` is a separate
 * fact the caller has to act on: a sheet that has been shrunk to the floor
 * and STILL does not fit needs a scrollbar, and one that fits does not.
 *
 * Every input can arrive NaN or zero. Both sizes come from measured DOM
 * boxes, and an element measured before layout, or while its ancestor is
 * hidden, reads 0 — which is exactly the state a board mounted off-screen
 * is in. A scale of 0 makes the whole projection vanish with nothing on
 * screen to explain it, so the guards below are the difference between a
 * readable fallback and a blank wall in front of a class.

/**
 * The largest font that still fits, SOLVED from two real readings rather than
 * approached by a ratio (#189).
 *
 * The projector measures, scales, and measures again -- and the second reading
 * routinely disagrees with the first, because the board's grid tracks are `em`:
 * shrinking the type narrows the columns and changes how many cards sit on a
 * row. Within one column regime the sheet is `a * font + C`, where `C` is every
 * `rem` and `px` part -- padding, gaps, borders -- that does not shrink with the
 * type at all. Correcting by the measured ratio `available / height` therefore
 * moves TOWARDS the answer without reaching it: measured on the real page, a
 * class of eight in pairs wanted 0.955, was nudged from 38.2px to 37.8px, and
 * still did not fit, so the board scrolled at almost full size.
 *
 * Two points define that line, and the caller is already holding both by the
 * time it needs to correct. So this is solved for no extra measuring and no
 * extra reflow.
 *
 * Pure, for the same reason `fitScale` is: the readings come from a real box,
 * and arithmetic that lives inside a measure-adjust-remeasure cycle cannot be
 * tested from outside it.
 *
 * A line that cannot be solved -- two readings at the same font, a sheet that
 * did not move, or one that GREW as the font shrank because a column boundary
 * added a row -- falls back to the ratio correction. Never to a NaN, an
 * Infinity, or a font of zero in front of a class.
