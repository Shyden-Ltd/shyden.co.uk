/**
 * Everything a collapsed section header needs to describe itself.
 *
 * `dirty` cannot be made `true` by anything built so far -- there is no
 * roster yet, and a roster is what gets lost. It is declared here because
 * the shape is needed now, and it is honest to default it `false`: with
 * nothing to lose, "nothing to save yet" is simply true. A future stage that
 * gives the roster a `dirty` flag owns setting it to exactly one rule (true
 * once a non-empty roster changes since the last export or import, false on
 * load/export/import) and writes the tests for that rule; this interface
 * only reserves the field so `sectionState` does not need a second, later
 * shape change.

 * The four collapsed headers' state strings.

 * Pure, and one function, because the failure this prevents is a header
 * that disagrees with the thing it describes -- and that only happens when
 * two places compute the same sentence. A unit test can pin every branch of
 * this against both locale tables; an end-to-end test can only ever sample
 * it.
 *
 * Returns three fields, not four: the fourth section (Sound & animation)
 * carries no accumulated state to forget -- sound and speed are simple,
 * always-visible preferences, not data a teacher could lose by collapsing
 * the section -- so no locale copy or design example defines a state
 * sentence for it, and this function does not invent one.
