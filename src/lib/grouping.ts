/**
 * Backtracking node cap. A class is at most a few dozen students with a
 * handful of constraints, so a real solution is found in far fewer steps than
 * this. The cap exists so a pathological input degrades into an honest
 * "cannot be done" rather than hanging the teacher's browser.
 *
 * Measured uncapped, on a keep-apart list shaped like "these three wind each
 * other up, and those three, and those three" -- the worst case for both the
 * clique search below and the assignment search in `assign`, AS THOSE
 * FUNCTIONS EXISTED AT THE TIME: 24 students took 27ms, 36 took 471ms, 42
 * took 7.3s, and 48 took 121.7s. (Formerly reproduced by a `moonMoser` test
 * helper, retired in Task 2 along with the free-text `keepApart` field that
 * fed it.) SUPERSEDED, not just old -- see the Task 5 paragraphs below: this
 * exact shape (many disjoint SAME-size cliques) no longer reproduces on the
 * current engine at all, at any size up to the 500-student ceiling. Kept
 * here as a record of why the cap exists and roughly what scale of danger it
 * was guarding against, not as a claim about current behaviour -- Task 5
 * needed an equivalently pathological letter-based input to re-prove that,
 * not to trust these numbers, and found this shape does not transfer.
 *
 * This cap now also bounds `assign`'s block-placement search (Fix round 1,
 * F-2/F-3), a second and different consumer -- pure bin-packing among
 * same-cost groups, no conflicts, since `pairs` is still always empty this
 * stage. The measurements above were never taken against that shape of
 * input, so they justify the cap for keep-apart only; they are not evidence
 * for the together-block case, and should not be read as if they were.
 * tests/unit/grouping.test.ts pins one concrete together-block input that
 * exhausts the cap (Fix round 1, F-3), but that is one data point, not a
 * growth curve -- nobody has yet measured where together-block search time
 * blows up the way the keep-apart numbers above do.
 *
 * Fix round 2: block placement can now call `assign` up to twice, once per
 * pass (see `placeBlocks`). This cap is spent PER CALL, not once for the
 * whole placement -- each pass opens its own node counter at zero -- so the
 * true worst case for block placement is 2x this many nodes, not this many,
 * on the rare input that defeats both the shuffled order and
 * first-fit-decreasing.
 *
 * Task 5 re-measured against the CURRENT engine (block-based, two-pass) with
 * real letter-fed conflicts, rather than trusting the paragraph above -- and
 * the old shape turned out not to transfer. Many disjoint cliques, all the
 * SAME size (the literal old shape: "these three, and those three"),
 * measured trivially fast here regardless of scale or how tightly capacity
 * is drawn: 8 to 20 triangles (24-60 students) into 3 groups, several
 * tightness variants including capacity matching the clique size exactly,
 * and a "Latin square" shape (K disjoint K-cliques into K groups of exactly
 * K, zero slack anywhere) up to K=22 (484 students, just under
 * MAX_STUDENTS) -- every one resolved in low single-digit milliseconds. The
 * reason: this engine's placer tries groups in a FIXED ascending order for
 * every block, so a perfectly regular shape (every clique the same size,
 * every group the same capacity) lets first-fit self-balance into a valid
 * arrangement without ever needing to backtrack, however large it is scaled.
 *
 * UNEVEN clique sizes is what actually defeats it. Six disjoint cliques
 * sized 20, 19, 18, 17, 16 and 15 (105 students) into exactly 20 groups
 * (tests/unit/grouping.test.ts, "apart letters" debt (b) test) reliably
 * exhausts the cap: 334 of 400 seeds measured gave up outright and the other
 * 66 succeeded, confirming this is a common outcome for the shape rather
 * than one unlucky seed -- seed 1 (this engine's default in tests) is among
 * the 334, reproducibly, at ~51-57ms. Every block in that input is a
 * singleton (no `together`), so pass 2's first-fit-decreasing sort is a
 * no-op there (a stable sort over equal-size keys preserves order) and
 * replays pass 1's exhausted search node for node -- confirmed by temporary
 * instrumentation on that exact input, not assumed from the stable-sort
 * argument alone: pass 1 gaveUp=true/found=false, pass 2
 * gaveUp=true/found=false, and pass 2's order verified byte-identical to
 * pass 1's. Both passes are genuinely defeated on that input, matching the
 * two-pass docstring's own "rare input that defeats both" case above.
 *
 * Fix round 1, F-1: this budget is now spent once per CANDIDATE allocation
 * `buildSeparateGroups`'s search tries under `separate`/`groupCount`, not
 * once per side/pass only -- see the accounting and acceptability judgment
 * in `placeBlocks`'s own doc comment, and the candidate-bounding reasoning

/**
 * Pass 1's block order under `mix`: shuffled, then woven by a ratio merge —
 * emitting from whichever side (boys or girls) has fallen furthest behind
 * its share of the blocks emitted so far.
 *
 * WHAT THE CODE DOES, first: `sexOf` reads the block's FIRST member and
 * classifies the WHOLE block by that one member's sex — it does not check
 * that every member agrees. A together-block spanning both sexes (one boy,
 * one girl) is therefore silently classified into `boys` or `girls` by
 * whichever sex its first member happens to be; it does NOT fall into
 * `rest`. (Task 7's own comment here previously said the opposite — "it
 * falls into `rest`, which is the only honest thing to do with it" — that
 * was never what this code did; Fix round 1 corrects the comment, not the
 * classification, which is unchanged and still pinned by the "places a
 * together-block spanning both sexes" test in grouping.test.ts.) `rest`
 * holds only a block whose first member's sex is neither `'M'` nor `'F'` —
 * `null`, `undefined`, or any other off-domain value a non-TypeScript
 * caller might hand this pure module (Fix round 1, F-2: `sexOf` normalises
 * anything that is not exactly `'M'` or `'F'` to `null` before classifying,
 * so `boys`, `girls` and `rest` are provably exhaustive and mutually
 * exclusive over EVERY index in `indices` — a permutation by construction,
 * not by the assumption the pre-fix code rested on). In practice `rest` is
 * unreachable from `mix`'s own call site specifically: `weaveBySex` only
 * ever runs after buildGroups's unset-sex guard has confirmed every
 * PRESENT student's `sex` is exactly `'M'` or `'F'`. That guard covers
 * `separate` too as of Task 8a (see `ERROR_CODES.sexNeedsAllSet`'s doc
 * comment) — but `weaveBySex` itself is not what makes that safe: it is
 * written to survive a caller that carries no such guarantee at all, guard
 * widened, guard narrow, or no caller-side guard whatsoever, as when a test
 * calls it directly. See the "never drops a block, whatever `sex` holds"
 * test in grouping.test.ts, which does exactly that.
 *
 * WHY A RATIO MERGE, not straight alternation. `indices` must already be
 * shuffled — this only sorts them into the boy, girl and rest lists,
 * preserving whatever order they arrive in within each list; that is what
 * supplies the variety in WHICH boy and WHICH girl lands in each slot, same
 * as before — pinned by the "varies which boy pairs with which girl across
 * seeds, not just the 1-and-1 split" and "varies pairings on the uneven
 * roster too, not just the evenly-divided one" tests in grouping.test.ts,
 * not by a narrative measurement alone. What changed is HOW the two lists
 * are merged. The original alternation (`woven[i] = boys[i], girls[i]`,
 * i = 0..max(nb,ng)) exhausts the shorter list partway through and then
 * appends the remainder of the longer one as ONE CONTIGUOUS RUN — and
 * `assign` fills groups in ascending order via first-fit, so that run lands
 * as a single-sex group every time.
 * Fix round 1, F-1: measured on the shipped alternation, 2 boys and 4 girls
 * into 2 groups landed the ideal {1M2F, 1M2F} split ZERO times in 200
 * seeds, while `off` (no weave at all) landed it 107 times — the feature
 * made its own goal less likely than not having it. See
 * docs/superpowers/notes/2026-08-06-classroom-groups-v2-engine-measurements.md,
 * "The five-shape table" for the full reproduction across five roster
 * shapes: `mix` now lands the ideal split 200/200 on every one of them,
 * `off` never better than 58%.
 *
 * The merge below counts BLOCKS, not students: `bi`/`gi` are how many boy-
 * and girl-blocks have been emitted so far, and a boy-block is emitted next
 * when `bi * ng <= gi * nb` (the boy side's share-so-far is still at or
 * below its true share of the two block counts) — a girl-block otherwise —
 * and whichever side is exhausted yields unconditionally to the other. This
 * spreads the minority side proportionally across every position instead of
 * front-loading it, so the excess of the majority side is spread out too,
 * rather than landing as one trailing block.
 *
 * NOT weighted by block SIZE, deliberately, and only after building and
 * measuring the weighted version. A together-block's size is invisible to
 * this count: a 4-student together-block counts as one "boy" the same as a
 * lone boy, so it can still clump — measured on a 4-boy together-block plus
 * 4 lone boys and 8 lone girls into 4 groups, block-COUNT `mix` lands
 * {2M2F, 1M3F, 1M3F, 4M0F} (the best any ordering can do, since a block the
 * exact size of a group cannot share it with anyone) on 100/100 seeds,
 * beating `off`'s 58/100. A student-WEIGHTED variant of this same merge
 * (emit by cumulative student count against each side's true total, so a
 * size-4 block counts as 4) was built and measured on the identical roster:
 * it reached that same best split only 36/100 seeds, WORSE than `off`. The
 * mechanism: weighting makes a block's size a forward-looking "debt" against
 * the OTHER side that persists after the block is placed — the big block
 * pushes `bTotal` to 4 in one step, and the merge then owes girls four turns
 * in a row to let `gTotal` catch up, clumping the very thing it was meant to
 * spread, even though the big block has already claimed its own group and
 * has no further claim on the remaining ones. Block-count weighting has no
 * memory of a block's size once its single turn is taken, which is exactly
 * why it does not make this mistake. Rejected on measurement, not
 * intuition; see
 * docs/superpowers/notes/2026-08-06-classroom-groups-v2-engine-measurements.md,
 * "The block-size-weighted merge: tried, measured, and rejected" for the
 * full comparison, including a second together-block shape where
 * block-count `mix` beats
 * `off` by roughly 2x without reaching the ideal every time (30.7% vs
 * 15.3%), and a third where a pair of exactly-group-sized blocks of the
 * same sex forces the identical worst split on `mix` and `off` alike — a
 * hard limit no ordering can move, not a regression.
 *
 * EXPORTED, unlike every other helper in this module, for exactly one
 * reason (Fix round 1, F-2): its total-partition guarantee -- every index in
 * `indices` lands in exactly one of `boys`, `girls`, `rest` -- has to hold
 * for ANY caller, not just the ones reachable through `buildGroups` today.
 * `mix` is the only caller `buildGroups` actually has (`placeBlocks` weaves
 * only when `sexMode === 'mix'`; `separate` still takes the plain shuffled
 * order -- true when this was written for Task 8a's placeholder placement,
 * and still true after Task 8b's real separate-mode placement landed:
 * `buildSeparateGroups` calls `placeBlocks` with `sexMode: 'separate'`, per
 * side, which takes the exact same unwoven branch it always did; see
 * `ERROR_CODES.sexNeedsAllSet`'s doc comment for the guard history), and
 * that guard refuses
 * every off-domain `sex` before `mix` can reach this function, so there is
 * no path through `buildGroups` left to exercise the guarantee with bad
 * data -- proving it as a property of THIS function, not of `buildGroups`'s
 * current callers, needs a direct call. See the "never drops a block,
 * whatever `sex` holds" test in grouping.test.ts.

/**
 * Two-pass placement (Fix round 2).
 *
 * Pass 1 tries the blocks in the shuffled order, unsorted — exactly what
 * this placer did before Fix round 1. This is what supplies arrangement
 * variety: the search meets blocks in an unpredictable order, and the
 * backtracking fill lands differently seed to seed. If it succeeds, that
 * arrangement is used and pass 2 never runs, so the common path — nearly
 * every real class — costs exactly the one search it always needed.
 *
 * Task 7 adds one more shape to pass 1's order, under `mix` only: the
 * shuffled order is woven boy-girl-boy-girl before `assign` ever sees it
 * (see `weaveBySex`). This is still "pass 1, unsorted" in the sense that
 * matters — no comparison of block SIZE or conflict COUNT is applied, which
 * is what Fix round 1 got wrong — it is a fixed interleave over an order
 * that is still shuffled underneath, so variety survives (proven in
 * docs/superpowers/notes/2026-08-06-classroom-groups-v2-engine-measurements.md,
 * "Singleton-block shapes") exactly as it did before this task. `sexMode`
 * values other than `mix` take this same shuffled order unchanged in THIS
 * function -- true for `off` at every call this function has ever had, and
 * true for `separate` too, though what "a call" means for `separate`
 * changed under Task 8b: this function itself is untouched (still exactly
 * one `sexMode === 'mix'` branch), but `buildSeparateGroups` now calls it
 * once PER SIDE rather than `buildGroups` calling it once for the whole
 * roster (see `buildSeparateGroups`, and the SEARCH_NODE_CAP paragraph
 * below for what that costs). None of that touches what `off` computes --
 * confirmed byte-identical, see the report for Task 8b and
 * docs/superpowers/notes/2026-08-06-classroom-groups-v2-engine-measurements.md,
 * "mix: byte-identical under off and separate" for Task 7's own original
 * measurement of this function in isolation.
 *
 * If pass 1 runs to completion WITHOUT giving up, that is already a complete
 * proof that no arrangement exists at this group count: `assign` is an
 * exhaustive backtracking search over every valid group choice for every
 * block, so the order it meets blocks in changes how many nodes it visits
 * before deciding, never what it is capable of deciding. A second pass in a
 * different order cannot find an arrangement the first pass already proved
 * does not exist, so none is run — see the call site in `buildGroups` for
 * where that proof is reported.
 *
 * Only when pass 1 hits SEARCH_NODE_CAP — proving nothing, "I stopped
 * looking" — does pass 2 run, with blocks sorted largest-first
 * (first-fit-decreasing, the standard bin-packing heuristic). That sort is
 * what cleared Fix round 1's "gave up" cases (13 of 1540 measured
 * together-rosters, down to 0): it trades away the variety pass 1 exists to
 * protect, but only once pass 1 has already shown the varied order cannot
 * decide this particular case within budget. Pass 2 sorts a COPY of pass 1's
 * own shuffled order, rather than shuffling again, so both passes draw from
 * the same sequence of `random` calls — there is no second, independent
 * source of randomness here, only a second look at the first one's output.
 * Under `mix` that copy is of the WOVEN order, and the size sort discards
 * the weave along with everything else about pass 1's order — deliberately:
 * pass 2 exists purely as the robustness fallback once pass 1's order,
 * whatever shape it had, has already failed to find a fit within budget, and
 * mixing is a preference that has already lost to finding ANY valid
 * arrangement by the time pass 2 runs at all.
 *
 * SEARCH_NODE_CAP is a PER-PASS budget, not a shared one: each call to
 * `assign` opens its own `nodes` counter at zero (see `assign`'s closure),
 * so the worst case — pass 1 gives up, then pass 2 also gives up — visits up
 * to 2 * SEARCH_NODE_CAP nodes and costs roughly twice one pass's time. That
 * only happens on an input that defeats first-fit-decreasing outright (see
 * the "gave up" test in grouping.test.ts, where every block is the same
 * size so pass 2's sort cannot help); every other input pays for one pass.
 *
 * Task 8b: under `separate`, THIS function is called up to twice more —
 * once per side that gets its own placement attempt, from
 * `buildSeparateGroups` via `placeSexSide` — and each of those calls is
 * everything above, independently: its own shuffled order, its own
 * possible pass 2, its own SEARCH_NODE_CAP budget per pass. The cap is PER
 * SIDE, exactly like it is per pass — a side that gives up spends only its
 * own budget; it neither borrows from nor lends to the other side's. So
 * the true worst case under `separate` is up to 2 (sides) * 2 (passes) = 4
 * * SEARCH_NODE_CAP nodes on a single `buildGroups` call, twice the 2 *
 * SEARCH_NODE_CAP worst case above for one `placeBlocks` call, and reached
 * only if BOTH sides independently hit the rare shape that defeats
 * first-fit-decreasing outright, in the same call. `off` and `mix` are
 * unaffected: they still call this function exactly once, so their worst
 * case is still 2 * SEARCH_NODE_CAP, unchanged by any of this.
 *
 * Fix round 1, F-1: under `separate` with `mode.kind === 'groupCount'`,
 * `buildSeparateGroups` can now try several CANDIDATE splits of the
 * requested group count between the two sexes (see `allocationCandidates`),
 * not just the one proportional guess — and each candidate it tries pays
 * the full "up to 4 * SEARCH_NODE_CAP" cost above independently, exactly as
 * if it were the only one. With up to `count - 1` candidates possible (see
 * `allocationCandidates`'s doc comment for why it is usually far fewer —
 * bounded by each side's own headcount too, not just `count - 1`), the true
 * worst case for one `buildGroups` call under `separate` grows to
 * `(candidates tried) * 4 * SEARCH_NODE_CAP` — at the 500-student ceiling,
 * as much as roughly 499 * 800,000 ≈ 4*10^8 nodes. Judged acceptable, not
 * papered over: see `allocationCandidates`'s doc comment for the full
 * reasoning (the common path — including the input that motivated this fix
 * — resolves in one or two candidates; only an input BOTH large enough to
 * offer that many candidates AND adversarially shaped to defeat
 * first-fit-decreasing at every one of them approaches the theoretical
 * ceiling, and even then the search always terminates, bounded, rather than
 * hanging). `perGroup` is untouched by this — see `allocateSexGroups`'s own
 * doc comment for why no search applies there — so its worst case is still
 * exactly the 4 * SEARCH_NODE_CAP figure above, unchanged.

 * a request that guess cannot satisfy was refused even when some OTHER way
 * of splitting the same total between the two sexes would have worked. The

 * bound together. Proportional gives 2-and-2; the 5-strong unit does not
 * fit a group of 4 (8 girls / 2 groups), so the old code refused. 3-and-1
 * (boys claim 3 groups; girls get ONE group of all 8, which holds the unit
 * easily) satisfies every rule the teacher stated -- the engine just never
 * looked for it.
 *
 * This turns that single guess into an ORDERED LIST of candidates for
 * `buildSeparateGroups` to try in turn, stopping at the first that
 * actually places. Only called once `mode.kind === 'groupCount'` is
 * already established (see the call site) -- under `perGroup` each side's
 * group count is independently and uniquely determined by its own
 * headcount and the fixed group SIZE (see `allocateSexGroups`'s own doc
 * comment: "no total to reconcile"), so there is no allocation CHOICE to
 * search over, and this function is not involved at all.
 *
 * WHY PROPORTIONAL FIRST, not simply searching for any feasible split: it
 * is the fairest arrangement by headcount whenever it works, and it is
 * also, right now, THE answer for every `separate`/`groupCount` input that
 * already succeeds -- this fix must not change any of those (see the
 * report's before/after verification). Trying it first and returning the
 * instant it succeeds is what GUARANTEES that: an input that succeeds on
 * the first candidate reaches `placeSexSide` with the exact same
 * arguments, in the exact same order, consuming the exact same sequence of
 * `random()` calls, as it did before this function existed -- nothing
 * about `buildSeparateGroups`'s own placement code changes, only how many
 * times it might now be invited to try again after a failure.
 *
 * `proportional` is always safe to try -- meaning it can never itself
 * request more groups for a side than that side has students, the exact
 * failure mode the headcount bound below exists to keep every OTHER
 * candidate from causing (see next paragraph): given the upstream
 * `mode.count <= boysCount + girlsCount` guarantee (`buildGroups`'s
 * `tooManyGroups` check), `rawBoys = boysCount * mode.count / (boysCount +
 * girlsCount) <= boysCount` always, so `boysFloor <= boysCount`, and the
 * one way that could still be pushed over by the largest-remainder's +1 --
 * `rawBoys` landing exactly ON the integer `boysCount` while STILL
 * claiming the remainder -- cannot happen either: `rawBoys == boysCount`
 * (with `girlsCount > 0`) forces `mode.count == boysCount + girlsCount`
 * exactly, which forces `rawGirls == girlsCount` too, which leaves no
 * remainder to award at all. Girls symmetrically.
 *
 * WHY BOUNDED BY EACH SIDE'S OWN HEADCOUNT for every OTHER candidate, not
 * the full `[1, count - 1]` range "count - 1 ways to divide" describes in
 * the abstract: a candidate that hands a side more groups than it has
 * students would size some of that side's groups to zero
 * (`targetSizes`'s `base` floors to 0 once `groupCount` exceeds `total`)

 * any lower would over-allocate girls), `boysCount` is what caps it from
 * above -- a SUBSET of "count - 1 ways", never more, so "at most count -
 * 1" still holds. In a lopsided roster (say 3 boys, 97 girls, 50 groups)
 * this collapses the real search space to just a handful of candidates,
 * not 49 -- most of the theoretical range would over-allocate the smaller
 * side, and is never even generated. See `placeBlocks`'s doc comment for
 * what this bound means for SEARCH_NODE_CAP's worst case, and why the
 * worst case is judged acceptable despite growing.
 *
 * Ties at equal distance (`proportional.boys - d` and `proportional.boys +
 * d` both in range) are tried fewer-boys-first -- an arbitrary but
 * deterministic and stated order, exactly as arbitrary as
 * `allocateSexGroups`'s own "a tie goes to boys". Correctness does not

 * its own (only reachable under `perGroup` -- see `allocateSexGroups`'s
 * doc comment for the proof that `groupCount`'s largest-remainder always

 * Fix round 1, F-1/F-2. `attemptSplit`, below, is everything this function
 * used to do unconditionally for the ONE split `allocateSexGroups`
 * computed: build whichever shape of `attempts` that (boysGroups,
 * girlsGroups) pair calls for (spill, or one attempt per side), place each
 * through `placeSexSide`, and report success or the first failure. It is
 * now parameterised so it can be asked about more than one split.
 *
 * `perGroup` still asks it about exactly one -- there is no allocation
 * CHOICE to search over there (see `allocateSexGroups`), so a failure is
 * reported directly, unchanged from before this fix. `groupCount` asks
 * `allocationCandidates` for an ordered list and tries each in turn,
 * stopping at the first success; if every candidate fails, `perGroup`-style
 * direct reporting is still correct when only one candidate existed to try
 * (no ambiguity, so no reason to withhold which side/rule failed) --
 * `candidates.length === 1` is what distinguishes that from a genuine
 * multi-candidate exhaustion, which reports `sexSeparateImpossible` or
 * `sexSeparateSearchGaveUp` instead -- see their own doc comments, the
 * former for why naming a side or a rule would be dishonest once several
 * different splits have all been tried, the latter (Fix round 2) for why
