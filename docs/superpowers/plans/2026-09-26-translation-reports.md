# Translation reports (#97) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Status:** DRAFT, under review (section "Review log" at the end).

**Goal:** A visitor on any beta-locale page can report a specific bad
translation from the footer, and the report lands in a D1 table the operator
reads and deletes once it has been dealt with.

**Architecture:** One pure, site-safe module (`src/lib/report.ts`) owns the
page table, the reportable strings, quote matching and the endpoint logic. The
footer imports it at build time for its `<datalist>`, and two thin Pages
Functions (`functions/api/report/index.js`, `health.js`) import it at run
time, so what is offered and what is accepted cannot drift apart. The homepage
posts a plain form and lands on a `:target` status. The two tool pages enhance
the same form with `fetch`, so a typed roster survives.

**Tech Stack:** Astro 7 (static), Cloudflare Pages Functions on workerd, D1,
wrangler (exact-pinned devDependency), Vitest 5, Playwright 1.63.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-translation-reports-design.md`
(APPROVED 2026-09-25 after 7 review passes). Every section number below is
that spec's.

## Global Constraints

- Beta locales are derived with `isBetaLocale(lang)`, never listed. English
  never shows the form (spec 3.1).
- Field limits: `quote` 1–1000 UTF-16 code units and not blank;
  `suggestion` and `note` 0–1000. Lengths are counted **after** folding CRLF to
  LF and **before** normalisation (6.1).
- The body cap is **64 KiB** (65,536 bytes). A body of exactly that many bytes
  passes check 4, and one more byte answers `413` (6.1).
- Check order is exactly 1 → 9 of spec 6.1. Check 5 (`locale`/`page`) comes
  **before** the honeypot (6).
- JSON mode: `sent` 200 (the honeypot decoy too), `not-found` 422, `rejected`
  400, check 5 400, `failed` 503. Checks 1–4 keep 405/403/415/413 (6.1).
- Every endpoint response carries `Cache-Control: no-store` and
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (6.1).
- Redirect mode answers `303` with `Location` = `localisePath(route, locale)`
  + `#report-<outcome>`, built only from the checked `locale` and `page`.
- On `failed`, the log line carries the error's name and message only. It
  never carries the quote, suggestion, note or any header (6.3).
- No personal data: no IP, cookie or user agent stored (8).
- The English copy is the operator-approved table in spec 3.5, verbatim.
- Status paragraphs carry `role="status"` and `tabindex="-1"`, and sit outside
  the `<details>` (3.2, 3.4).
- The homepage gains no script. Its inventory stays the inline theme script
  alone (`theme-script.spec.ts`) (3.3).
- Hit areas are at least 44 × 44 px, colours come from palette tokens only, and
  every input has `width: 100%` and `box-sizing: border-box` (3.4).
- The honeypot is visually hidden with `clip-path` in a 1px box. It uses no
  `display: none` and no absolute or off-screen positioning (3.2).
- No new npm package except `wrangler`, the operator's decision of
  2026-09-23 (spec section 2). The version is exact-pinned (`4.x.y`, no caret).
- Never create a wrangler config at the repository root. Pages would take it as
  both projects' source of truth (11, assumption 2).
- Never type a backslash-u escape into a file when the bytes matter. Build the
  character in code (`String.fromCharCode(0x2026)`), because the Write and
  Edit tools decode a typed escape (standing rule, 2026-09-15).
- Every new export starts as a stub that throws `new Error('not implemented')`.
  Every new test is seen failing on its own assertion, and any test that
  passes against a stub is a finding (10).
- Mutation runs execute the **whole** file, never a `-t` filter (10).

### Clarifications this plan makes (the spec is silent on them)

1. **Stored key names** follow the repo's existing unit-key convention
   (`back-translate.ts`, `label-check.ts`): site copy is `site.<path>`
   (`site.footer.registered`) and tool copy is its bare catalogue path
   (`errors.NO_STUDENTS`, `themes.animals[3]`). `renderedOn()` already reads
   keys in this form.
2. **Control characters.** Spec 10 lists "control characters" among check 7's
   boundaries but names no verdict. Check 7 answers `rejected` when any field
   holds a code point below U+0020 other than TAB and LF, or one in
   U+007F–U+009F. No browser form can produce one, and a stray NUL makes a
   D1 console row unreadable.
3. **JSON bodies.** Checks 1–4 answer with an empty body in both modes. Check 5
   in JSON mode answers `400 {"outcome":"rejected"}`, so the tool-page script
   shows the `rejected` status.
4. **An absent honeypot field** counts as empty.
5. **Rule 3 is matched without a regular expression.** A pattern like
   `^a.+b.+c$` backtracks polynomially on a 1000-unit quote. An anchored
   literal scan is exact for literal runs separated by non-empty wildcards,
   and it is linear.
6. **Rule 3 needs fixed wording.** A form whose literal runs hold fewer than
   2 characters in all (a message that is only `{name}`, say) would match
   every quote as "a whole rendered message", which would make check 8
   accept anything on that page. Rule 3 applies only to a form whose literal
   runs, joined and normalised, are at least 2 characters long, counted the
   way rule 2 counts.

## Review Focus

These are the inputs the spec implies but none of its tests exercises, most
likely first. Each one has a test in the owning task.

1. **A tool-page visitor double-clicks "Send report".** Exactly one report is
   stored, because the button is disabled while a submission is in flight.
   Task 10, `a double click stores one report`.
2. **A tool page gets a response it cannot read**, such as a 403, a 413, an
   HTML error page or a network failure. The page shows `failed` and throws
   nothing. Task 9: the `outcomeOf` unit tests (403, HTML, a foreign body),
   and the e2e test against the preview, whose answer to a POST is not ours.
3. **A Thai quote of one grapheme cluster that is three code points**
   (ที่). Rule 2 needs 2 graphemes, so it is `not-found`, and two clusters
   match. Task 5.
4. **Chinese fullwidth quotation marks** (U+FF02, U+FF07) and a modifier
   apostrophe (U+02BC) fold like the typographic ones, so a pasted zh string
   matches. Task 5.
5. **A second submission on a tool page after a first outcome.** Exactly one
   status is visible, and it is the new one. Task 10,
   `a later outcome replaces the earlier one`.

## Before Task 1: ask the operator for the Cloudflare setup

Dev verification calls `/api/report/health` and fails closed without a
binding, so the merge waits on spec section 9's steps 1–2. Ask now, so the
setup is done by the time the PR is ready.

- [ ] Send a `PushNotification` and ask Shyden with `AskUserQuestion`. The
      question text carries the steps themselves, because he does not see prose
      outside it:
      "#97 needs two D1 databases and a binding before its PR can merge.
      (1) `npx wrangler d1 create shyden-reports-dev` and
      `npx wrangler d1 create shyden-reports`. (2) Once `migrations/0001_reports.sql`
      is on the branch (Task 7), run
      `npx wrangler d1 execute <name> --remote --file migrations/0001_reports.sql`
      for each. (3) Pages → `shyden-site-dev` → Settings → Bindings → D1 →
      variable `REPORTS` → `shyden-reports-dev`, and the same for
      `shyden-site` → `shyden-reports`. Steps 3–4 of the spec (the WAF rule, and
      confirming the Workers plan) come before the prod release. Will you do
      steps 1–3 now, or once the migration is pushed?"
      Options: "Now; I'll apply the migration when it's pushed" /
      "Once the migration is pushed". Continue with Task 1 either way.

### Task 1: wrangler is an exact-pinned devDependency that the deploys use

**Files:**
- Modify: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- Modify: `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml:130-136`, `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml:70-76`
- Test: `tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts` (new `describe` at the end)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `npx wrangler` resolves to the locked copy in every later task.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing guard.** Append to
      `tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts`. `allWorkflows`, `DEPLOY_COMMAND`,
      `nonEmpty`, `searched` and `readFileSync` are already in scope there.

```ts
/**
 * wrangler comes from the lockfile (#97, spec section 9).
 *
 * Both deploy workflows ran `npm install -g wrangler@4`, so any 4.x could
 * arrive at deploy time and bundle the Pages Functions differently from the
 * last deploy of the same commit. The locked copy is what the tests ran, and
 * Dependabot's npm ecosystem moves it as a reviewable diff.
 */
describe('wrangler comes from the lockfile (#97)', () => {
  it('is an exact-pinned devDependency', () => {
    const pkg = JSON.parse(readFileSync('package.json', 'utf8')) as {
      devDependencies: Record<string, string>;
    };
    expect(pkg.devDependencies.wrangler).toMatch(/^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/);
  });

  it('no workflow installs it globally', () => {
    const workflows = allWorkflows();
    const global = workflows
      .filter(({ text }) =>
        /\bnpm\s+(?:install|i)\b[^\n]*(?:\s-g\b|\s--global\b)[^\n]*\bwrangler\b/.test(
          text,
        ),
      )
      .map(({ name }) => name);
    expect(
      searched(global, {
        of: workflows.map(({ text }) => text),
        what: 'workflow texts',
      }),
    ).toEqual([]);
  });

  it('every deploy runs the locked copy', () => {
    const deploys = nonEmpty(
      allWorkflows().flatMap(({ name, text }) =>
        text
          .split('\n')
          .filter((line) => line.includes(DEPLOY_COMMAND))
          .map((line) => `${name}: ${line.trim()}`),
      ),
      'wrangler deploy lines',
    );
    expect(
      deploys.filter((line) => !line.includes(`npx ${DEPLOY_COMMAND}`)),
    ).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it red.**
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts`
      Expected: FAIL, three tests. `devDependencies.wrangler` is `undefined`;
      `global` lists `deploy-dev.yml` and `deploy-prod.yml`; the deploy lines
      read `wrangler pages deploy …` with no `npx`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Install and pin.** Take the version from the last line of
      `npm view wrangler@4 version` (4.141.0 on 2026-09-26), then:
      Run: `npm install --save-dev --save-exact wrangler@<version> 2>&1 | tail -20`
      Read the whole tail. If npm reports a lifecycle script blocked by
      `allowScripts`, run `npx wrangler --version`. When it fails, add that
      exact `name@version: true` entry to `package.json`'s `allowScripts` and
      reinstall; grant only the scripts wrangler needs to run. Then run
      `command grep -rn "allowScripts" tests/unit` and satisfy any guard that
      reads the list.

- [ ] **Step 4: Switch both workflows.** In each deploy step, delete the
      `npm install -g wrangler@4` line and change
      `wrangler pages deploy dist …` to `npx wrangler pages deploy dist …`.
      Both jobs already run `npm ci` earlier (deploy-dev.yml:125,
      deploy-prod.yml:46), so the locked copy is present.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run it green, then the whole unit suite.**
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts` → PASS.
      Run: `npm run test:unit 2>&1 | tail -6` → all pass.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.**

```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json .github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml .github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts
git commit -m "build(deps): wrangler is an exact-pinned devDependency the deploys use (Refs #97)"
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Mutate both ways.** Put `npm install -g wrangler@4` back in
      `deploy-dev.yml`. Predict RED on `no workflow installs it globally`, run
      the whole file, and confirm. Restore with `git checkout -- .github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`
      (HEAD is the green commit). Then change the pin to `^<version>`: predict
      RED on `is an exact-pinned devDependency`, confirm, and restore.

### Task 2: measure the six assumptions before building on them

Spec section 11 says to measure each assumption first. This is a throwaway
spike: nothing from it is committed except the Measurements table below.

**Files:**
- Create (throwaway, deleted in Step 7): `functions/api/spike.js`,
  `functions/api/spike-db.js`
- Create: `tests/functions/wrangler.toml` (kept if Step 3 uses it; Task 10
  commits it)
- Modify: this plan's "Measurements" table

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the Measurements table, which Tasks 5, 7, 8 and 10 read to choose
  between each assumption's primary path and its fallback.

- [ ] **Step 1: A spike Function that exercises the bundle.** Create
      `functions/api/spike.js`:

```js
// THROWAWAY (#97 Task 2): deleted before any commit.
import { getSiteStrings, getStrings } from '../../src/lib/i18n/index';
import { parseMessage } from '../../src/lib/i18n/message';

export const onRequest = () => {
  const thai = String.fromCharCode(0x0e17, 0x0e35, 0x0e48);
  const decomposed = String.fromCharCode(0x65, 0x0301);
  const graphemes =
    typeof Intl.Segmenter === 'function'
      ? [
          ...new Intl.Segmenter('th', { granularity: 'grapheme' }).segment(
            thai + thai,
          ),
        ].length
      : -1;
  return Response.json({
    site: getSiteStrings('vi').footer.registered,
    toolKeys: Object.keys(getStrings('vi')).length,
    parts: parseMessage('{n, plural, one {# a} other {# b}}').length,
    segmenter: typeof Intl.Segmenter,
    graphemes,
    nfcLength: decomposed.normalize('NFC').length,
    lower: 'I'.toLocaleLowerCase('vi'),
  });
};
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Serve it with no root config** (assumptions 1 and 2), in the
      background. `DEV_PASSWORD` is bound because `functions/_middleware.js`
      gates every non-prod hostname and fails closed without it:

```bash
npm run build > /dev/null 2>&1; echo build=$?
npx wrangler pages dev dist --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8799 \
  --compatibility-date 2026-09-01 \
  --d1 REPORTS=00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000097 \
  --persist-to .wrangler/functions-spike \
  --binding DEV_PASSWORD=functions-local > "$SCRATCH/pages-dev.log" 2>&1
```

      (Set `SCRATCH` to the session's scratchpad directory first, in the same
      command, since shell state does not persist between calls. Run the
      `pages dev` command with `run_in_background: true`.) Then
      `curl -s -u dev:functions-local http://127.0.0.1:8799/api/spike`.
      Record: did the bundle build (a `Compiled Worker successfully` line and
      no error in the log)? Did the JSON come back? Compare every field with
      the same expressions run in Node: `node -e` with the same code, importing
      the `.ts` files directly (Node 24 strips types).
      **Assumption 1 holds** when the bundle builds and `site`, `toolKeys` and
      `parts` match Node. **Assumption 3 holds** when `segmenter`,
      `graphemes` (expect 2), `nfcLength` (expect 1) and `lower` match Node.

- [ ] **Step 3: Apply the migration to that local D1 without a root config**
      (assumptions 2 and 5). Write the spec 7 migration to
      `$SCRATCH/0001_reports.sql` (Task 7 commits the same text). Create
      `tests/functions/wrangler.toml`:

```toml
# Local only: the functions-runtime tests' D1 (#97). Never at the repository
# root, where Pages would take it as both projects' source of truth and
# displace their dashboard bindings (spec section 11, assumption 2).
name = "shyden-site-functions-test"
compatibility_date = "2026-09-01"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "REPORTS"
database_name = "reports-local"
database_id = "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000097"
```

      Then:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute reports-local --local --persist-to .wrangler/functions-spike \
  --config tests/functions/wrangler.toml --file "$SCRATCH/0001_reports.sql" > "$SCRATCH/d1-apply.log" 2>&1; echo rc=$?
npx wrangler d1 execute reports-local --local --persist-to .wrangler/functions-spike \
  --config tests/functions/wrangler.toml --json \
  --command "SELECT name FROM pragma_table_info('reports')" > "$SCRATCH/d1-pragma.json" 2>&1; echo rc=$?
```

      **Assumption 5 holds** when both exit 0, the `CHECK` constraints are
      accepted, and the pragma returns the eight column names.
      Now prove the running `pages dev` sees the same database. Create
      `functions/api/spike-db.js` holding
      `export const onRequest = async ({ env }) => Response.json(await env.REPORTS.prepare("SELECT name FROM pragma_table_info('reports')").all());`,
      restart `pages dev`, and `curl -s -u dev:functions-local http://127.0.0.1:8799/api/spike-db`.
      **Assumption 2 holds** when the Function lists the same eight columns.
      If it lists none, the two tools keyed the store differently: record the
      sqlite files under `.wrangler/functions-spike/v3/d1/` and try
      `--d1 REPORTS=reports-local`. If neither shares the file, the fallback
      is to apply the migration by opening that one sqlite file with
      Node's built-in `node:sqlite` after `pages dev` has created it; record
      which.

- [ ] **Step 4: Read a row back while `pages dev` runs.** Insert one row
      through `wrangler d1 execute … --command "INSERT …"` and read it with
      `--json --command "SELECT …"`. Record whether the read works while the
      server holds the database. Task 10's row reader uses whichever works.

- [ ] **Step 5: `_headers` under `pages dev`** (assumption 6).
      `curl -s -D - -o /dev/null -u dev:functions-local http://127.0.0.1:8799/vi/ | command grep -i referrer-policy`
      **Assumption 6 holds** when `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
      comes back.

- [ ] **Step 6: Assumption 4 is measured in Task 8**, where the e2e status
      test runs on all five engines. Record "Task 8" here.

- [ ] **Step 7: Clean up and record.** Stop `pages dev` (TaskStop), then
      `rm functions/api/spike.js functions/api/spike-db.js` and
      `rm -rf .wrangler/functions-spike`. Confirm `git status --short functions`
      prints nothing. Keep
      `tests/functions/wrangler.toml` only if Step 3 used it. Fill the table
      below with the measured values, not the expected ones, and commit only
      the plan:

```bash
git add docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-26-translation-reports.md
git commit -m "docs(plan): measure #97's six assumptions (Refs #97)"
```

#### Measurements (filled by Task 2)

| # | Assumption | Result, measured | Path taken |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | bundler follows imports into `src/lib/*.ts`, no Node APIs | | primary / build-step module fallback |
| 2 | local D1 bound and migrated with no root config | | shared store / `node:sqlite` fallback |
| 3 | `Intl.Segmenter`, `normalize` same in workerd as Node 24 | | graphemes / code points |
| 4 | `:target` and fragment focus in five engines | measured in Task 8 | per engine |
| 5 | D1 accepts the `CHECK`s and `pragma_table_info` | | primary / no-CHECK + `sqlite_schema` |
| 6 | `pages dev` applies `dist/_headers` | | primary / unit pin fallback |

**If assumption 1 fails:** add a Task 5a before Task 7. A script
(`scripts/report-table.mjs`, run by `npm run build` before `astro build`)
writes `functions/_generated/report-table.js` exporting
`reportableStrings`' output for every page and locale. The Function then
imports that module instead of `src/lib/i18n`. Record this in the
Measurements table and review the amended plan again before continuing.

**If assumption 6 fails:** Task 10's `Referrer-Policy` mutation moves to a unit
test. Add it to `tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts`:
`it('public/_headers keeps a Referrer-Policy under which a POST keeps its Origin', …)`,
reading `public/_headers` and asserting the value is one of
`strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `strict-origin`, `origin`,
`origin-when-cross-origin`, `same-origin`, `no-referrer-when-downgrade` or
`unsafe-url`, and never `no-referrer`.

---

### Task 3: the catalogue walk moves to a site-safe home

`tests/catalogue-leaves.ts` holds the repo's one catalogue walk, and
`one-home.test.ts` pins it there. Shipped code cannot import the test tree,
so spec 4.2's rule applies: the walk moves to a shared site-safe module, and
the test tree re-exports it.

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/catalogue-leaves.ts`
- Modify: `tests/catalogue-leaves.ts` (becomes a re-export)
- Modify: `tests/unit/one-home.test.ts:219-286`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `catalogueLeaves(table: unknown, path?: string): Array<[string, unknown]>`
  and `stringLeaves(table: unknown): Array<[string, string]>` from
  `src/lib/catalogue-leaves.ts`, with the same behaviour as today.

- [ ] **Step 1: Point the one-home rule at the new home (red).** In
      `tests/unit/one-home.test.ts`, replace the `it('is implemented only in catalogue-leaves.ts', …)`
      body with:

```ts
  it('is implemented only in src/lib/catalogue-leaves.ts', () => {
    // The walk moved out of the test tree for #97, because the Pages Function
    // that validates a report needs it and shipped code cannot import tests/.
    // The rule still scans the test tree; it adds the one home in src/.
    const HOME = 'src/lib/catalogue-leaves.ts';
    const scanned = [...SCANNED.filter((path) => path.startsWith('tests/')), HOME];
    expect(
      scanned.filter((path) =>
        definesACatalogueWalker(readFileSync(path, 'utf8')),
      ),
    ).toEqual([HOME]);
  });
```

      Update the docblock above it: its first line reads
      "Walking a copy table lives in one place too: `src/lib/catalogue-leaves.ts`,
      which `tests/catalogue-leaves.ts` re-exports." Its KNOWN LIMIT paragraph
      gains one sentence: "The walk itself now ships (#97); its behaviour is
      pinned by `catalogue-leaves.test.ts`, which the move does not change."

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it red.**
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/one-home.test.ts`
      Expected: FAIL. `readFileSync` throws ENOENT for `src/lib/catalogue-leaves.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Move the walk.** `git mv tests/catalogue-leaves.ts src/lib/catalogue-leaves.ts`.
      Its docblock's mention of `one-home.test.ts` stays true. Then create
      `tests/catalogue-leaves.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * The catalogue walk, for the test tree. It lives in
 * `src/lib/catalogue-leaves.ts` since #97, because the Pages Function that
 * validates a translation report walks the same tables, and shipped code
 * cannot import tests/. Every existing importer keeps this path.
 */
export { catalogueLeaves, stringLeaves } from '../src/lib/catalogue-leaves';
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green, then the whole unit suite** (eleven files import
      the walk).
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/one-home.test.ts tests/unit/catalogue-leaves.test.ts` → PASS.
      Run: `npm run test:unit 2>&1 | tail -6` → all pass.
      Run: `npm run typecheck 2>&1 | command grep -E "(error|warning|hint)s?"` → exactly three
      lines, each reading 0.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
git add src/lib/catalogue-leaves.ts tests/catalogue-leaves.ts tests/unit/one-home.test.ts
git commit -m "refactor(i18n): the catalogue walk moves to a site-safe home (Refs #97)"
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Mutate.** Paste a private copy of the walk (the
      `gather` snippet from `one-home.test.ts`'s own "whatever it is called"
      test) into a scratch file, `tests/unit/scratch-walker.test.ts`. Predict RED on
      `is implemented only in src/lib/catalogue-leaves.ts`, run the whole file,
      and confirm. Delete the scratch file and confirm green.

### Task 4: the `report` copy, in five locales

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/lib/i18n/site.ts` (a `report` section in `siteEn`, `siteId`,
  `siteZh`, `siteVi`, `siteTh`)
- Modify: `src/lib/i18n/label-check.ts:142-152` (`report: CHROME`)
- Create: `tests/unit/report-copy.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `SiteStrings['report']` with the keys `open`, `intro`,
  `quoteLabel`, `quoteHint`, `suggestionLabel`, `noteLabel`, `noteHint`,
  `honeypotLabel`, `send`, `sent`, `notFound`, `rejected`, `failed`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Pin the approved English (red).** Create
      `tests/unit/report-copy.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import { siteEn } from '../../src/lib/i18n/site';

/**
 * The report form's English, as the operator approved it on 2026-09-23 (#97,
 * spec 3.5). A literal pin, because a level needs one: every other guard
 * derives from the catalogue, so an edit here would move both sides together.
 */
describe('the report copy is the approved English (#97)', () => {
  it('matches spec 3.5 word for word', () => {
    expect(siteEn.report).toEqual({
      open: 'Report a translation problem',
      intro:
        'Reports go to Shyden Ltd and are deleted once they have been dealt with.',
      quoteLabel: 'Which words are wrong?',
      quoteHint:
        'Start typing and choose the words from the list, or copy them from the page.',
      suggestionLabel: 'What should it say? (optional)',
      noteLabel: 'Anything else? (optional)',
      noteHint: "Please don't include names or contact details.",
      honeypotLabel: 'Leave this field empty',
      send: 'Send report',
      sent: 'Thank you. Your report has been sent.',
      notFound:
        "We couldn't find those words on this page. Choose them from the list, or copy a shorter piece without any names or numbers.",
      rejected:
        "That report couldn't be sent. Please check the form and try again.",
      failed:
        "Something went wrong and your report wasn't sent. Please try again later.",
    });
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it red.**
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/report-copy.test.ts`
      Expected: FAIL, `siteEn.report` is `undefined` (astro check would also
      refuse the property; vitest runs first).

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the English section.** In `siteEn`, after `language`, add
      `report: { … }` with exactly the thirteen strings above, each written
      with straight ASCII apostrophes as in the test.

- [ ] **Step 4: Draft id, zh, vi and th.** `SiteStrings` is derived from
      `siteEn`, so `npm run typecheck` now fails on four missing sections. Add a
      `report` section to each, machine-drafted like the rest of the file (no
      native speaker is available, operator 2026-09-20). Each draft follows
      its locale's existing house wording: read that locale's `footer`,
      `language` and `glory` sections first, reuse their word for "report",
      "translation", "page" and "optional", and write zh and th without spaces
      between words. `notFound` keeps its two sentences.

- [ ] **Step 5: Map the section in `label-check.ts`.** Add `report: CHROME,`
      to `SITE_PAGES`. The form sits in the footer of every beta page, so
      `renderedOn('site.report.send')` answers "the header or footer of every
      page". Without it, the live-catalogue tests throw
      `site.ts has no section "report"`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run every i18n guard, then the whole unit suite.**
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/report-copy.test.ts tests/unit/i18n.test.ts tests/unit/dead-copy.test.ts tests/unit/locale-fallbacks.test.ts tests/unit/message-parity.test.ts tests/unit/label-check.test.ts tests/unit/verified-labels.test.ts 2>&1 | tail -30`
      Expected: `report-copy` passes. `dead-copy` FAILS, listing the `report`
      group, because nothing in `src/` reads `.report` yet. That is correct:
      Task 8 renders the copy, so leave it red until then and note it in the
      commit. (Its individual keys may already pass on unrelated names, such
      as `.open` on a `<details>`. That is why Task 9 Step 7 checks what
      actually holds the section.) If `label-check` or
      `verified-labels` flags a `report.*` label of three words or fewer
      (likely `send`), resolve it the way that file's own failure message says
      (a cross-check against the locale's prose that uses the same English,
      or an entry in its awaiting-the-operator list). Never loosen the guard.
      Every other guard must pass.
      Run: `npm run typecheck 2>&1 | command grep -E "(error|warning|hint)s?"` → three lines, 0 each.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit** (dead-copy stays red until Task 8; do not push until then).

```bash
git add src/lib/i18n/site.ts src/lib/i18n/label-check.ts tests/unit/report-copy.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(i18n): the report form's copy, approved English and four drafts (Refs #97)"
```

      The pre-push hook runs the unit suite, so this branch is not pushed
      between Task 4 and Task 8.

- [ ] **Step 8: Mutate.** Change `send: 'Send report'` to `'Send'`. Predict
      RED on `matches spec 3.5 word for word`, confirm, and restore.

---

### Task 5: `src/lib/report.ts` — the page table, the strings, and matching

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/lib/i18n/index.ts` (add `rawCatalogue`)
- Create: `src/lib/report.ts`
- Create: `tests/unit/report.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `catalogueLeaves` (Task 3); `SiteStrings['report']` (Task 4).
- Produces, all from `src/lib/report.ts`:
  - `PAGE_IDS: readonly ['home', 'glory-points', 'classroom-groups']`
  - `type PageId = (typeof PAGE_IDS)[number]`
  - `isPageId(value: unknown): value is PageId`
  - `pageIdFromPath(pathname: string): PageId | null`
  - `pagePath(page: PageId, locale: Locale): string`
  - `interface ReportForm { readonly display: string; readonly runs: readonly string[] }`
  - `interface ReportableString { readonly key: string; readonly forms: readonly ReportForm[] }`
  - `reportableStrings(page: PageId, locale: Locale): readonly ReportableString[]`
  - `reportOptions(page: PageId, locale: Locale): readonly string[]`
  - `normalise(text: string, locale: Locale): string`
  - `matchesForm(needle: string, form: ReportForm, locale: Locale): boolean`
    (both sides already normalised)
  - `matchingKeys(quote: string, page: PageId, locale: Locale): string[]`
- Produces from `src/lib/i18n/index.ts`: `rawCatalogue(locale: Locale): Catalogue`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add `rawCatalogue` and the stubs.** In `src/lib/i18n/index.ts`,
      after `getStrings`:

```ts
/**
 * A locale's tool catalogue as written, every message still a template.
 * `getStrings` compiles each message into a function (#136), so a walk over
 * its result never sees one: 139 keys against 197. The translation-report
 * table (#97) walks this instead.
 */
export const rawCatalogue = (locale: Locale): Catalogue => CATALOGUES[locale];
```

      Create `src/lib/report.ts` with the docblock below, the types, the
      `PAGE_IDS` constant, and every function throwing
      `new Error('not implemented')`:

```ts
/**
 * Translation reports (#97). Which strings a page offers a visitor to
 * report, how a quote is matched against them, and the `/api/report`
 * endpoint.
 *
 * ONE HOME (spec 4.2). The footer imports this at build time for its
 * `<datalist>`, and the Pages Functions import it at run time to validate a
 * report, so what is offered and what is accepted cannot drift apart. It is
 * site-safe: it must never import a CLI-only module (`cli-only.test.ts`),
 * and it runs on workerd, so no Node API either.
 */
import { catalogueLeaves } from './catalogue-leaves';
import {
  DEFAULT_LOCALE,
  getSiteStrings,
  localisePath,
  rawCatalogue,
  type Locale,
  type SiteStrings,
} from './i18n';
import { isMessageTemplate, parseMessage, type MessagePart } from './i18n/message';

export const PAGE_IDS = ['home', 'glory-points', 'classroom-groups'] as const;
export type PageId = (typeof PAGE_IDS)[number];

export interface ReportForm {
  /** What the `<datalist>` offers: the literal text with each slot as an ellipsis. */
  readonly display: string;
  /** The literal text between slots: one more run than there are slots. */
  readonly runs: readonly string[];
}

export interface ReportableString {
  /** `site.<path>` for site copy, the bare catalogue path for tool copy. */
  readonly key: string;
  readonly forms: readonly ReportForm[];
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run green, then everything.**
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/report.test.ts` → PASS.
      Run: `npm run test:unit 2>&1 | tail -6` → only `dead-copy`'s report keys
      fail (Task 8 fixes them).
      Run: `npm run typecheck 2>&1 | command grep -E "(error|warning|hint)s?"` → three lines, 0 each.
      Run: `npx prettier --write src/lib/report.ts src/lib/i18n/index.ts tests/unit/report.test.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.**

```bash
git add src/lib/report.ts src/lib/i18n/index.ts tests/unit/report.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(report): the page table, reportable strings and quote matching (Refs #97)"
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Mutate, whole file each time, predicting first.**
      (a) Delete `'glory-points'`'s `siteSection` → RED on the glory leaves
      test. (b) Accept any quote (`return reportableStrings(page, locale).map(({ key }) => key);`
      at the top of `matchingKeys`) → RED on "matches nothing" and on "spans a
      slot". (c) Change `>= 2` to `>= 1` → RED on "refuses one character".
      (d) Replace `lengthOf` with `text.length` → RED on the Thai test.
      (e) Set `wholeMessageAllowed` to `form.runs.length > 1` → RED on
      "rule 3 needs two characters of fixed wording". (f) In `wholeMessage`,
      search from `at` instead of `at + 1` → RED on `'ab1c'` (an empty
      first slot). (g) Change the last line of `wholeMessage` to `>= at` →
      RED on `'a1bc'` (an empty last slot).
      Restore each with `git checkout -- src/lib/report.ts`.

### Task 6: `src/lib/report.ts` — the endpoint, the health check, and logging

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/lib/report.ts` (append)
- Create: `tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `isPageId`, `pagePath`, `normalise`, `matchingKeys` (Task 5);
  `isLocale`, `isBetaLocale` from `./i18n`.
- Produces, from `src/lib/report.ts`:
  - `MAX_FIELD_UNITS = 1000`, `MAX_BODY_BYTES = 65536`
  - `REPORT_COLUMNS: readonly ['id', 'received_at', 'locale', 'page', 'quote', 'keys', 'suggestion', 'note']`
  - `type Outcome = 'sent' | 'not-found' | 'rejected' | 'failed'`
  - `interface ReportsStatement { bind(...values: unknown[]): ReportsStatement; run(): Promise<unknown>; all<T>(): Promise<{ results: T[] }> }`
  - `interface ReportsDatabase { prepare(query: string): ReportsStatement }`
  - `interface ReportEnv { readonly REPORTS?: ReportsDatabase }`
  - `handleReport(request: Request, env: ReportEnv, log?: (line: string) => void): Promise<Response>`
  - `reportHealth(env: ReportEnv, log?: (line: string) => void): Promise<Response>`
  - `schemaMatches(columns: readonly string[]): boolean`

- [ ] **Step 1: Stubs.** Append the constants, the types and three throwing
      functions with the signatures above. Add `isBetaLocale, isLocale` to the
      `./i18n` import.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests.** Create
      `tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import {
  MAX_BODY_BYTES,
  MAX_FIELD_UNITS,
  REPORT_COLUMNS,
  handleReport,
  reportHealth,
  schemaMatches,
} from '../../src/lib/report';
import { getSiteStrings } from '../../src/lib/i18n';

/**
 * Real `Request` objects, no stand-in database (spec 10). Checks 1–8 return
 * before the database is touched, so they need none; `failed` runs with the
 * REPORTS binding absent, which is a real failure the health check also
 * reports. Check 9 succeeding is proved on a real local D1 (Task 10).

- [ ] **Step 3: Run red.**
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts 2>&1 | tail -40`
      Expected: every test FAILS with `not implemented`, except the
      `REPORT_COLUMNS` literal. That one fails on `schemaMatches`. Any PASS is
      a finding.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement.** Replace the three stubs:

```ts
const JSON_STATUS: Record<Outcome, number> = { sent: 200, 'not-found': 422, rejected: 400, failed: 503 };
/** `_headers` does not apply to Function responses, so every answer sets its own (spec 6.1). */

  text.length >= min && text.length <= MAX_FIELD_UNITS && !hasControlCharacter(text);

/** A textarea's maxlength counts a line break as one unit; submission sends CRLF (spec 6.1). */
const field = (fields: URLSearchParams, name: string): string => (fields.get(name) ?? '').replace(/\r\n/g, '\n');

const describeError = (error: unknown): string =>
  error instanceof Error ? `${error.name}: ${error.message}` : 'NonError: a value that is not an Error was thrown';

export async function handleReport(request: Request, env: ReportEnv, log: (line: string) => void = console.error): Promise<Response> {

  const type = (request.headers.get('Content-Type') ?? '').split(';')[0].trim().toLowerCase();
  if (type !== FORM_TYPE) return plain(415);
  if (Number(request.headers.get('Content-Length') ?? 0) > MAX_BODY_BYTES) return plain(413);
  const body = await request.arrayBuffer();
  if (body.byteLength > MAX_BODY_BYTES) return plain(413);

  try {

    await env.REPORTS.prepare(INSERT)
      .bind(crypto.randomUUID(), new Date().toISOString(), locale, page, quote, JSON.stringify(keys), suggestion, note)
      .run();
  } catch (error) {

export const schemaMatches = (columns: readonly string[]): boolean =>
  columns.length === REPORT_COLUMNS.length && REPORT_COLUMNS.every((column) => columns.includes(column));

/** Proves the binding and the migration without writing a row, and returns no counts or content (spec 6.2). */
export async function reportHealth(env: ReportEnv, log: (line: string) => void = console.error): Promise<Response> {
  let ok = false;
  try {
    if (!env.REPORTS) throw new Error('the REPORTS binding is missing');
    const { results } = await env.REPORTS.prepare(HEALTH_QUERY).all<{ name: string }>();
    ok = schemaMatches(results.map(({ name }) => name));
    if (!ok) log('report health: the reports table does not match the migration');
  } catch (error) {
    log(`report health: ${describeError(error)}`);
  }
  return json({ ok }, ok ? 200 : 503);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run green, then everything.**
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts tests/unit/report.test.ts` → PASS.
      Run: `npm run typecheck 2>&1 | command grep -E "(error|warning|hint)s?"` → three lines, 0 each.
      Run: `npx prettier --write src/lib/report.ts tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.**

```bash
git add src/lib/report.ts tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(report): the endpoint's nine checks, the health check and a clean log (Refs #97)"
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Mutate, whole file each time, predicting first** (spec 10's
      endpoint mutations). Restore each with `git checkout -- src/lib/report.ts`.
      (a) Store when the honeypot is filled: delete the `website` line → RED
      on check 6, because the missing binding logs a line. (b) Remove the
      Origin check → RED on check 2. (c) Build `Location` from
      `request.headers.get('Referer')` when present → RED on "never from
      Referer". (d) `MAX_FIELD_UNITS` → `Infinity` in `within` → RED on the
      1001 tests. (e) Swap `'not-found': 422` and `rejected: 400` → RED in
      JSON mode. (f) `reportHealth` answers `json({ ok: true }, 200)` without
      querying → RED on the 503 test. (g) Log `quote` in the catch → RED on
      the leak test. (h) Move the honeypot line above check 5 → RED on "5 comes
      before the honeypot". (i) Count before folding: drop `.replace(/\r\n/g, '\n')`
      in `field` → RED on the CRLF test.

### Task 7: the migration, the Functions, and the runbook

**Files:**
- Create: `migrations/0001_reports.sql`
- Create: `functions/api/report/index.js`, `functions/api/report/health.js`
- Create: `docs/runbooks/translation-reports.md`
- Modify: `tests/unit/cli-only.test.ts` (liveness), `tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts` (migration pin)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `handleReport`, `reportHealth`, `REPORT_COLUMNS` (Task 6).
- Produces: `POST /api/report` and `GET /api/report/health` on any Pages
  deployment of this repo.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tests.** Append to `tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts`
      (add `import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';` and
      `import { codeWithoutComments } from './source-text';`). Both read
      comment-stripped text, so a comment naming a column or an import cannot
      satisfy them (standing rule, #23):

```ts
describe('the migration', () => {
  // SQL line comments stripped: the migration's own column notes must not satisfy this.
  const sql = () =>
    readFileSync('migrations/0001_reports.sql', 'utf8')
      .split('\n')
      .map((line) => line.replace(/--.*$/, ''))
      .join('\n');

  it('creates exactly the columns the endpoint writes and the health check expects', () => {
    const body = /CREATE TABLE reports \(([\s\S]*)\);/.exec(sql())?.[1];
    expect(body, 'a CREATE TABLE reports statement').toBeDefined();
    const columns = body!
      .split('\n')
      .map((line) => line.trim())
      .filter(Boolean)
      .map((line) => line.split(/\s+/)[0]);
    expect(columns).toEqual([...REPORT_COLUMNS]);
  });

  it('bounds every text column the way check 7 does', () => {
    const text = sql();
    expect(text).toContain(`CHECK (length(quote) BETWEEN 1 AND ${MAX_FIELD_UNITS})`);
    expect(text).toContain(`CHECK (length(suggestion) <= ${MAX_FIELD_UNITS})`);
    expect(text).toContain(`CHECK (length(note) <= ${MAX_FIELD_UNITS})`);
  });
});

describe('the Pages Functions are plumbing only', () => {
  it.each([
    ['functions/api/report/index.js', 'handleReport'],
    ['functions/api/report/health.js', 'reportHealth'],
  ])('%s hands the request to %s', (file, handler) => {
    const code = codeWithoutComments(file, readFileSync(file, 'utf8'));
    expect(code).toMatch(new RegExp(`import \\{ ${handler} \\} from '\\.\\./\\.\\./\\.\\./src/lib/report'`));
    expect(code).toMatch(/^export const onRequest/m);
  });
});
```

      And in `tests/unit/cli-only.test.ts`, after `'resolves the imports it judges'`:

```ts
  it('walks the Pages Functions too', () => {
    // #97 put site code behind a Function. functions/ has been in the walk
    // since #54; this proves the new one is reached, not merely listed.
    expect(shipped()).toContain('functions/api/report/index.js');
    expect(importsOf('functions/api/report/index.js').map(stem)).toContain('src/lib/report');
  });
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red.**
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts tests/unit/cli-only.test.ts 2>&1 | tail -20`
      Expected: FAIL with ENOENT for the migration and both Functions.

- [ ] **Step 3: The migration.** Create `migrations/0001_reports.sql` with
      spec section 7's statement verbatim (the `CREATE TABLE reports (…);`
      block, including its column comments).

- [ ] **Step 4: The Functions.** Create `functions/api/report/index.js`:

```js
/**
 * POST /api/report — a translation report from the footer form (#97).
 *
 * Plumbing only, like `_middleware.js`: every check lives in
 * `src/lib/report.ts`, unit-tested with real Request objects. Any method
 * reaches it, so the handler itself answers 405 with `Allow: POST`.
 *
 * ESM is required: wrangler ships ZERO Functions for a file using CommonJS.
 */
import { handleReport } from '../../../src/lib/report';

/** @param {{ request: Request, env: import('../../../src/lib/report').ReportEnv }} context */
export const onRequest = ({ request, env }) => handleReport(request, env);
```

      Create `functions/api/report/health.js`:

```js
/**
 * GET /api/report/health — proves the REPORTS binding and the migration
 * without writing a row (#97, spec 6.2). 200 {"ok":true} or 503 {"ok":false}.
 *
 * Behind the dev Basic Auth gate like every other path; a no-op gate on prod.
 */
import { reportHealth } from '../../../src/lib/report';

/** @param {{ request: Request, env: import('../../../src/lib/report').ReportEnv }} context */
export const onRequest = ({ request, env }) =>
  request.method === 'GET'
    ? reportHealth(env)
    : new Response(null, {
        status: 405,
        headers: { Allow: 'GET', 'Cache-Control': 'no-store', 'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff' },
      });
```

      If Task 2 took assumption 1's fallback, the imports read the generated
      table module instead (Task 5a).

- [ ] **Step 5: The runbook.** Create `docs/runbooks/translation-reports.md`:

````markdown
# Translation reports — runbook (#97)

Reports from the footer form land in the D1 table `reports`: database
`shyden-reports` on prod, `shyden-reports-dev` on dev, each bound to its Pages
project as `REPORTS`. A row exists only while its report is pending. Dealing
with a report deletes it; nothing is kept "just in case".

Run these in the Cloudflare dashboard's D1 console.

```sql
SELECT id, received_at, locale, page, quote, keys, suggestion, note
  FROM reports ORDER BY received_at;
DELETE FROM reports WHERE id = ?;   -- once the report has been dealt with
-- dev database only: the rows the dev sanity suite writes, one per dev deploy
DELETE FROM reports WHERE note LIKE 'automated dev check %';
```

**A ticket raised from a report goes into a public repository.** It carries
the locale, the key and, once reviewed, the suggested wording. It never
carries the note.

`GET /api/report/health` answers `200 {"ok":true}` when the binding and the
table's columns match `migrations/0001_reports.sql`, and `503` otherwise. The
dev and prod sanity suites call it after every deploy.
````

- [ ] **Step 6: Run green, then everything.**
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts tests/unit/cli-only.test.ts` → PASS.
      Run: `npm run typecheck 2>&1 | command grep -E "(error|warning|hint)s?"` → three lines, 0 each.
      This is where assumption 1 is proven in `astro check`: the Functions are
      `checkJs`, so a bad import path or JSDoc type fails here.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit.**

```bash
git add migrations/0001_reports.sql functions/api/report docs/runbooks/translation-reports.md tests/unit/report-endpoint.test.ts tests/unit/cli-only.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(report): the reports migration, the two Functions and the runbook (Refs #97)"
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Mutate.** (a) Drop the `note` line from the migration → RED
      on "creates exactly the columns". (b) Leave the `note` column deleted but
      add a comment line `-- note TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` in its place →
      still RED, which proves the comment is stripped. (c) Comment out
      `index.js`'s import line and add a comment repeating it → RED on "hands
      the request to handleReport". Restore each.

### Task 8: the footer form, and its presence in every beta locale

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/components/Footer.astro`
- Create: `tests/e2e/report-presence.spec.ts` (no action, so no recording)
- Create: `tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts` (acts, so `test.use(recorded)`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `pageIdFromPath`, `reportOptions`, `MAX_FIELD_UNITS`, `type Outcome`
  (Tasks 5–6); `SiteStrings['report']` (Task 4).
- Produces: the DOM contract Task 9's script reads. These are
  `form[data-report-form]` inside `details[data-report]`, the fields `locale`,
  `page`, `quote`, `suggestion`, `note` and `website`, one
  `button[type="submit"]`, and four `p.report-status[data-report-status="<outcome>"]`
  with ids `report-sent`, `report-not-found`, `report-rejected` and
  `report-failed`, where a shown one carries `data-shown`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing presence tests.** Create `tests/e2e/report-presence.spec.ts`:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { test, expect } from './fixtures';
import { filesUnder, searched } from '../source-files';
import { PREFIXED_LOCALES, getSiteStrings, isBetaLocale, isLocale } from '../../src/lib/i18n';
import { PAGE_IDS, pagePath, reportOptions, type Outcome } from '../../src/lib/report';

/**
 * The report form's presence and contents, read from what was built (#97,
 * spec 3.2 and 10). Derived from dist/, so a page added later is judged the
 * day it is built, and English is covered by the same walk that covers the
 * beta locales.
 */
const BUILT = filesUnder('dist', (path) => /\.html$/.test(path)).map((file) => ({
  file,
  html: readFileSync(file, 'utf8'),
}));
const langOf = (html: string) => /<html[^>]*\slang="([^"]+)"/.exec(html)?.[1];

test('a built page with a footer carries the form exactly when its locale is beta', () => {
  const footed = BUILT.filter(({ html }) => html.includes('<footer'));
  const findings = footed.flatMap(({ file, html }) => {
    const lang = langOf(html);
    const want = isLocale(lang) && isBetaLocale(lang);
    const has = html.includes('data-report-form');
    return has === want ? [] : [`${file}: lang=${lang} form=${has}`];
  });
  expect(searched(findings, { of: footed.map(({ file }) => file), what: 'built pages with a footer' })).toEqual([]);
  expect(footed.filter(({ html }) => html.includes('data-report-form')).length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

for (const locale of PREFIXED_LOCALES)
  for (const page of PAGE_IDS)
    test(`${pagePath(page, locale)}: the type-ahead offers exactly this page's strings`, async ({ page: tab }) => {
      await tab.goto(pagePath(page, locale));
      const offered = await tab.locator('#report-strings option').evaluateAll((options) =>
        options.map((option) => (option as HTMLOptionElement).value),
      );
      expect(new Set(offered)).toEqual(new Set(reportOptions(page, locale)));
      expect(offered.length).toBe(reportOptions(page, locale).length);
    });

const OUTCOMES: readonly Outcome[] = ['sent', 'not-found', 'rejected', 'failed'];
const COPY: Record<Outcome, 'sent' | 'notFound' | 'rejected' | 'failed'> = {
  sent: 'sent',
  'not-found': 'notFound',
  rejected: 'rejected',
  failed: 'failed',
};

for (const locale of PREFIXED_LOCALES)
  for (const outcome of OUTCOMES)
    test(`${locale}: #report-${outcome} shows, takes focus, and hides the rest`, async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto(`${pagePath('home', locale)}#report-${outcome}`);
      const shown = page.locator(`#report-${outcome}`);
      await expect(shown).toBeVisible();
      await expect(shown).toHaveText(getSiteStrings(locale).report[COPY[outcome]]);
      await expect(shown).toHaveAttribute('role', 'status');
      await expect(shown).toBeFocused();
      for (const other of OUTCOMES.filter((o) => o !== outcome)) {
        await expect(page.locator(`#report-${other}`)).toHaveCount(1);
        await expect(page.locator(`#report-${other}`)).toBeHidden();
      }
    });
```

      **Assumption 4.** If an engine fails `toBeFocused` while `toBeVisible`
      passes, re-run that one test with full output to confirm the cause. Then
      add `browserName` to the test's fixtures and replace the focus line with
      `if (browserName === '<engine>') test.info().annotations.push({ type: 'focus-not-moved', description: '<the measured reason>' }); else await expect(shown).toBeFocused();`,
      naming only the engine that was measured. Record the engine and the
      reason in the Measurements table (row 4). The homepage gains no script
      to force focus (spec 11).

- [ ] **Step 2: Failing acting tests.** Create `tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts`:

```ts
import { test, expect } from './fixtures';
import { recorded } from './evidence';
import { atLeast44, expectNoHorizontalScroll } from '../viewport';
import { contrastRatio } from './helpers';
import { PREFIXED_LOCALES, getSiteStrings, getStrings } from '../../src/lib/i18n';
import { PAGE_IDS, pagePath } from '../../src/lib/report';

test.use(recorded);

test('the disclosure opens from the keyboard and walks its fields in order', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(pagePath('home', 'vi'));
  const t = getSiteStrings('vi').report;
  const summary = page.locator('[data-report] summary');
  await summary.focus();
  await page.keyboard.press('Enter');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-report]')).toHaveAttribute('open', '');
  for (const label of [t.quoteLabel, t.suggestionLabel, t.noteLabel]) {
    await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
    await expect(page.getByLabel(label, { exact: true })).toBeFocused();
  }
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: t.send })).toBeFocused();
  // The hints are joined by aria-describedby (spec 3.4).
  await expect(page.getByLabel(t.quoteLabel, { exact: true })).toHaveAccessibleDescription(t.quoteHint);
  await expect(page.getByLabel(t.noteLabel, { exact: true })).toHaveAccessibleDescription(t.noteHint);
});

test('every control is at least 44px and every text meets AA', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(pagePath('glory-points', 'th'));
  const t = getSiteStrings('th').report;
  await page.locator('[data-report] summary').click();
  for (const target of [
    page.locator('[data-report] summary'),
    page.getByLabel(t.quoteLabel, { exact: true }),
    page.getByLabel(t.suggestionLabel, { exact: true }),
    page.getByLabel(t.noteLabel, { exact: true }),
    page.getByRole('button', { name: t.send }),
  ])
    await atLeast44(target);
  for (const text of [
    page.locator('[data-report] summary'),
    page.locator('[data-report] form > p').first(),
    page.locator('#report-quote-hint'),
    page.locator('#report-note-hint'),
    page.locator('label[for="report-quote"]'),
  ])
    expect(await contrastRatio(text)).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(4.5);
});

for (const locale of PREFIXED_LOCALES)
  for (const pageId of PAGE_IDS)
    test(`${pagePath(pageId, locale)}: no sideways scroll at 320px with the form open`, { tag: '@emulated-viewport' }, async ({ page }) => {
      await page.setViewportSize({ width: 320, height: 800 });
      await page.goto(pagePath(pageId, locale));
      await page.locator('[data-report] summary').click();
      await expect(page.locator('[data-report]')).toHaveAttribute('open', '');
      await expectNoHorizontalScroll(page);
      // Page-level scrollWidth is not containment (CLAUDE.md): nothing in the
      // form may escape the footer's own column.
      const column = await page.locator('footer .inner').boundingBox();
      expect(column, 'the footer column has a box').not.toBeNull();
      const boxes = await page
        .locator('[data-report] form > *:not(.hp):not(input[type="hidden"]):not(datalist)')
        .evaluateAll((els) => els.map((el) => ({ right: el.getBoundingClientRect().right, name: el.tagName })));
      for (const box of boxes) expect(box.right, box.name).toBeLessThanOrEqual(column!.x + column!.width + 0.5);
      // Liveness by content, after the invariant: the widest controls were measured.
      expect(boxes.map(({ name }) => name)).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining(['INPUT', 'TEXTAREA', 'BUTTON']));
    });
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run red.** Build, then run both specs on one engine first:
      Run: `npm run build > /dev/null 2>&1; npx playwright test tests/e2e/report-presence.spec.ts tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts --project=chromium 2>&1 | tail -30`
      Expected: every test FAILS. The presence walk lists every beta page
      with `form=false`, and the other tests time out on the missing locators.
      English pages are not among the findings, because they rightly have no
      form. That is why the walk also asserts that at least one built page
      carries the form: without that line, a build with no form anywhere would
      fail only on the beta pages the walk happened to find.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the footer.** In `src/components/Footer.astro`'s
      frontmatter, add:

```ts
import { MAX_FIELD_UNITS, pageIdFromPath, reportOptions, type Outcome } from '../lib/report';

// The report form (#97): beta locales only, derived, so English never shows
// it. The page comes from the route, so no page has to remember a prop; a
// path the table does not know renders no form, and the presence check in
// report-presence.spec.ts fails on it rather than letting it go quietly.
const reportPage = isBetaLocale(lang) ? pageIdFromPath(Astro.url.pathname) : null;
const reportStatuses: ReadonlyArray<[Outcome, string]> = [
  ['sent', t.report.sent],
  ['not-found', t.report.notFound],
  ['rejected', t.report.rejected],
  ['failed', t.report.failed],
];
```

      In the markup, directly after the `betaNotice` paragraph:

```astro
    {reportPage && (
      <details class="report" data-report>
        <summary>{t.report.open}</summary>
        <form method="post" action="/api/report" data-report-form>
          <p>{t.report.intro}</p>
          <input type="hidden" name="locale" value={lang} />
          <input type="hidden" name="page" value={reportPage} />
          <label for="report-quote">{t.report.quoteLabel}</label>
          <input
            id="report-quote"
            name="quote"
            type="text"
            list="report-strings"
            required
            maxlength={MAX_FIELD_UNITS}
            autocomplete="off"
            aria-describedby="report-quote-hint"
          />
          <p id="report-quote-hint" class="hint">{t.report.quoteHint}</p>
          <datalist id="report-strings">

          </datalist>
          <label for="report-suggestion">{t.report.suggestionLabel}</label>
          <textarea id="report-suggestion" name="suggestion" maxlength={MAX_FIELD_UNITS}></textarea>
          <label for="report-note">{t.report.noteLabel}</label>
          <textarea
            id="report-note"
            name="note"
            maxlength={MAX_FIELD_UNITS}
            aria-describedby="report-note-hint"></textarea>
          <p id="report-note-hint" class="hint">{t.report.noteHint}</p>
          <div class="hp" aria-hidden="true">

            <input id="report-website" name="website" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off" />
          </div>
          <button type="submit">{t.report.send}</button>
        </form>
      </details>
    )}
    {reportPage &&
      reportStatuses.map(([result, text]) => (
        <p id={`report-${result}`} class="report-status" role="status" tabindex="-1" data-report-status={result}>
          {text}
        </p>
      ))}
```

      Append to the component's `<style>`:

```css
  /* The report form (#97). Tokens only, so the computed-style contrast
     guards apply; every control 44px; inputs take their width from the
     column, because an input's intrinsic width once pinned #cg-form wide at
     320px. */
  .report summary {
    min-height: 44px;
    padding-block: 0.6rem;
    cursor: pointer;
    color: var(--accent);
  }
  .report form {
    display: grid;
    gap: 0.5rem;
    margin-top: 0.5rem;
  }
  .report input,
  .report textarea {
    width: 100%;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    min-height: 44px;
    padding: 0.5rem;
    font: inherit;
    color: var(--ink);
    background: var(--bg);
    border: 1px solid var(--border);
    border-radius: 6px;
  }
  .report textarea {
    min-height: 5rem;
  }
  .report button {
    justify-self: start;
    min-width: 44px;
    min-height: 44px;
    padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
    font: inherit;
    color: var(--bg);
    background: var(--accent);
    border: 0;
    border-radius: 6px;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  /* Visually hidden in a 1px box in normal flow. Never display: none, which
     some bots skip; never positioned, which is how BetaBadge once produced
     sideways scroll at 320px. */
  .hp {
    width: 1px;
    height: 1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    clip-path: inset(50%);
    white-space: nowrap;
  }
  /* A status shows when it is the fragment's target (the homepage, after its
     303) or when the tool-page script marks it. Outside the <details>, which
     renders nothing while closed. */
  .report-status {
    display: none;
    color: var(--ink);
  }
  .report-status:target,
  .report-status[data-shown] {
    display: block;
  }
  @media print {
    .report,
    .report-status {
      display: none;
    }
  }
```

      Before settling the colours, check which tokens `contrast.test.ts` scores
      as a pair (`command grep -n "accent\|--bg\|--ink" tests/unit/contrast.test.ts | head`).
      The button's `--bg` on `--accent` and the summary's `--accent` on the
      footer ground must be pairs it already scores. If one is not, use the
      pair that `Button.astro` uses for a filled button, so that no new
      unscored pair is painted.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run green, all five engines.**
      Run: `npm run build > /dev/null 2>&1; npx playwright test tests/e2e/report-presence.spec.ts tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -30`
      Expected: all pass, unless an engine does not move focus (assumption 4;
      Step 1 says what to do). Then:
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/dead-copy.test.ts` → PASS now that the
      footer reads every `t.report.*` key.
      Run: `npm run test:unit 2>&1 | tail -6` → all pass. Watch for
      `evidence-recording`, `viewport-tagging`, `capture-after-assertion`,
      `absence-liveness` and `colour-literals`: when one flags the new code,
      change the code, never the guard.
      Run: `npm run test:e2e 2>&1 | tail -15` → the whole suite, default
      workers. A new `<details>` in every beta footer can meet any spec that
      derives disclosures or counts footer elements; read every failure's
      error text before touching anything.
      Run: `npx prettier --write src/components/Footer.astro tests/e2e/report-presence.spec.ts tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.**

```bash
git add src/components/Footer.astro tests/e2e/report-presence.spec.ts tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts
git commit -m "feat(report): the footer's report form in every beta locale (Refs #97)"
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Mutate, predicting first, whole spec file each time, on
      chromium.** Rebuild after every source edit (the suite measures `dist/`),
      and restore with `git checkout -- src/components/Footer.astro`. (a) Drop
      the `isBetaLocale` gate (`const reportPage = pageIdFromPath(…)`) → RED on
      the presence walk, English pages. (b) Gate it to `lang === 'vi'` → RED
      on the presence walk for id, zh and th. (c) Delete the
      `.report-status:target` selector → RED on every `#report-*` test.
      (d) `.report summary { min-height: 30px; }` → RED on 44px. (e)
      `#report-quote` gets `width: 400px` (append
      `.report #report-quote { width: 400px; }`) → RED on the 320px tests.
      (f) Put a `<script>console.log(1)</script>` inside the footer →
      `theme-script.spec.ts` RED on every page. Confirm each RED names the
      property you broke, then restore and confirm green.

### Task 9: the tool pages submit in place

**Files:**
- Create: `src/scripts/report-form.ts`
- Create: `tests/unit/report-form.test.ts`
- Modify: `src/scripts/glory-points.ts`, `src/scripts/classroom-groups.ts` (one call each)
- Modify: `tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the DOM contract from Task 8; `type Outcome` (type-only import).
- Produces: `enhanceReportForm(form: HTMLFormElement): void`,
  `outcomeOf(response: Response): Promise<Outcome>`,
  `showStatus(root: ParentNode, outcome: Outcome): HTMLElement | null`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Stubs and failing unit tests.** Create
      `src/scripts/report-form.ts` with the three exports throwing
      `not implemented`, and `tests/unit/report-form.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import { outcomeOf } from '../../src/scripts/report-form';

/** The tool-page script's reading of a response: real Response objects, no network. */
describe('outcomeOf', () => {
  const json = (body: unknown, status: number) =>
    new Response(JSON.stringify(body), { status, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } });

  it.each([
    ['sent', 200],
    ['not-found', 422],
    ['rejected', 400],
    ['failed', 503],
  ])('reads %s from its own status', async (outcome, status) => {
    expect(await outcomeOf(json({ outcome }, status))).toBe(outcome);
  });

  it('reads failed from anything it cannot trust', async () => {
    expect(await outcomeOf(new Response(null, { status: 403 }))).toBe('failed');
    expect(await outcomeOf(new Response('<!doctype html><p>Not found', { status: 404 }))).toBe('failed');
    expect(await outcomeOf(json({ outcome: 'hacked' }, 200))).toBe('failed');
    expect(await outcomeOf(json(null, 200))).toBe('failed');
    expect(await outcomeOf(json(['sent'], 200))).toBe('failed');
  });
});
```

      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/report-form.test.ts` → every test FAILS
      on `not implemented`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement.** Replace the stubs:

```ts
/**
 * The tool pages submit the report form in place (#97, spec 3.3).
 *
 * `/classroom-groups` keeps a teacher's roster in memory only, so a
 * full-page POST would wipe the class list. Each tool page's own script calls
 * `enhanceReportForm`; the footer carries no script, so nothing new reaches
 * the homepage, which keeps the plain POST and its `:target` status. If this
 * script fails to load, the plain POST still works, and there is then no
 * roster to lose.
 */
import type { Outcome } from '../lib/report';

const OUTCOMES: readonly Outcome[] = ['sent', 'not-found', 'rejected', 'failed'];
const isOutcome = (value: unknown): value is Outcome =>
  typeof value === 'string' && (OUTCOMES as readonly string[]).includes(value);

/** The outcome a response carries, and `failed` for anything else: a 403, an HTML page, a body that is not ours. */
export async function outcomeOf(response: Response): Promise<Outcome> {
  let body: unknown;
  try {
    body = await response.json();
  } catch {
    return 'failed';
  }
  const outcome = body && typeof body === 'object' && !Array.isArray(body) ? (body as { outcome?: unknown }).outcome : undefined;
  return isOutcome(outcome) ? outcome : 'failed';
}

/** Show exactly one status and move focus to it, as the fragment does on the homepage. */
export function showStatus(root: ParentNode, outcome: Outcome): HTMLElement | null {
  let shown: HTMLElement | null = null;
  for (const status of root.querySelectorAll<HTMLElement>('[data-report-status]')) {
    const match = status.dataset.reportStatus === outcome;
    status.toggleAttribute('data-shown', match);
    if (match) shown = status;
  }
  shown?.focus();
  return shown;
}

/** Send the form with fetch and never reload; one submission at a time. */
export function enhanceReportForm(form: HTMLFormElement): void {
  const button = form.querySelector<HTMLButtonElement>('button[type="submit"]');
  let pending = false;
  form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    if (pending) return;
    pending = true;
    if (button) button.disabled = true;
    const body = new URLSearchParams();
    for (const [name, value] of new FormData(form)) if (typeof value === 'string') body.append(name, value);
    let outcome: Outcome = 'failed';
    try {
      outcome = await outcomeOf(await fetch(form.action, { method: 'POST', headers: { Accept: 'application/json' }, body }));
    } catch {
      outcome = 'failed';
    } finally {
      pending = false;
      if (button) button.disabled = false;
    }
    if (outcome === 'sent') form.reset();
    showStatus(document, outcome);
  });
}
```

      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/report-form.test.ts` → PASS. Nothing
      calls `enhanceReportForm` yet.

- [ ] **Step 3: Failing e2e test for the tool page.** Append to
      `tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts` (`getStrings` is already in its i18n
      import). The preview serving `dist/` runs no Function, so a submission
      meets a response that is not ours. That is the `failed` path, and the
      roster must survive it (spec 3.3's hazard; Task 10 proves `sent` on the
      real runtime).

```ts
test('/vi/classroom-groups submits in place: failed shows, takes focus, and the roster survives', async ({ page }) => {
  const tool = getStrings('vi');
  const t = getSiteStrings('vi').report;
  await page.goto(pagePath('classroom-groups', 'vi'));
  await page.locator('#cg-students-toggle').click();
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: tool.rosterAddStudent }).click();
  await page.locator('.cg-student').first().getByLabel(tool.rosterColName).fill('Lan');
  await page.evaluate(() => ((window as unknown as { unreloaded: boolean }).unreloaded = true));

  await page.locator('[data-report] summary').click();
  await page.getByLabel(t.quoteLabel, { exact: true }).fill(t.open);
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: t.send }).click();

  const failed = page.locator('#report-failed');
  await expect(failed).toBeVisible();
  await expect(failed).toHaveText(t.failed);
  await expect(failed).toBeFocused();
  await expect(page.locator('#report-sent')).toBeHidden();
  expect(await page.evaluate(() => (window as unknown as { unreloaded?: boolean }).unreloaded)).toBe(true);
  await expect(page.locator('.cg-student').first().getByLabel(tool.rosterColName)).toHaveValue('Lan');
  await expect(page.getByLabel(t.quoteLabel, { exact: true })).toHaveValue(t.open);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it red.** Nothing is wired yet, so the form does a plain
      POST, and the preview answers with a page that is not the tool.
      Run: `npm run build > /dev/null 2>&1; npx playwright test tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts -g "submits in place" --project=chromium 2>&1 | tail -15`
      Expected: FAIL. `#report-failed` never becomes visible, because the
      browser navigated away and the roster went with it.

- [ ] **Step 5: Wire both tool scripts, and run green.** At the end of
      `src/scripts/glory-points.ts` and of `src/scripts/classroom-groups.ts`,
      add the lines below. Put the import after the file's last complete
      single-line import (`^import .*;$`), never inside a multi-line one:

```ts
import { enhanceReportForm } from './report-form';
// …
// The footer's report form exists only in beta locales (#97).
const reportForm = document.querySelector<HTMLFormElement>('[data-report-form]');
if (reportForm) enhanceReportForm(reportForm);
```

      Run: `npm run build > /dev/null 2>&1; npx playwright test tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -15` → all pass, five engines.
      Run: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/theme-script.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -5` → PASS.
      The tool pages still carry one external module each, because
      `report-form.ts` is bundled into it.
      Run: `npm run test:unit 2>&1 | tail -6` → all pass.
      Run: `npx prettier --write src/scripts/report-form.ts src/scripts/glory-points.ts src/scripts/classroom-groups.ts tests/unit/report-form.test.ts tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.**

```bash
git add src/scripts/report-form.ts src/scripts/glory-points.ts src/scripts/classroom-groups.ts tests/unit/report-form.test.ts tests/e2e/report-form.spec.ts
git commit -m "feat(report): the tool pages submit the report in place (Refs #97)"
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Mutate.** (a) Delete `event.preventDefault();` and rebuild →
      RED on the tool-page test: the roster is gone and `unreloaded` is
      undefined. (b) Delete `shown?.focus();` and rebuild → RED on
      `toBeFocused`. (c) Return `'sent'` from `outcomeOf`'s catch → RED in
      `report-form.test.ts`. Restore each with
      `git checkout -- src/scripts/report-form.ts`.
      (d) What holds the `report` copy in `dead-copy`? Its group check
      matches `\.report\b` anywhere in `src/`, and `from './report-form'`
      now satisfies it by itself. Delete the footer's whole report markup
      (not the frontmatter), and predict RED on `dead-copy` naming
      `report.quoteLabel`, `report.intro` and the other keys with distinctive
      names. Confirm that the key-level check is what catches it, and record
      that in the PR body. If it stays green, the section is unguarded: make
      `isReferenced` ignore module specifiers (strip `from '…'` and
      `import('…')` strings before matching), mutation-verify that change both
      ways, and commit it separately.

### Task 10: the real Function on workerd, in CI

**Files:**
- Create: `playwright.functions.config.ts`
- Create: `tests/functions/local.mjs`, `tests/functions/serve.mjs`,
  `tests/functions/report.spec.ts`; keep or create `tests/functions/wrangler.toml` (Task 2)
- Modify: `package.json` (`test:functions`), `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  (`functions` job, `build-and-test.needs`)
- Modify: `tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts` (the job guard)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything above; the Measurements table (rows 2, 3, 5, 6).
- Produces: `npm run test:functions`, and the `functions` CI job that
  `build-and-test` needs.

- [ ] **Step 1: The local constants and row reader.** Create
      `tests/functions/local.mjs`:

```js
/**
 * The functions-runtime tests' local stack (#97, spec 10): `wrangler pages
 * dev` serving dist/ with the real Functions on workerd, over a local D1 that
 * has the real migration applied. One home for the values the server, the
 * config and the specs must agree on.
 */
import { spawnSync } from 'node:child_process';

export const PORT = 8799;
export const BASE_URL = `http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}`;
/** The dev middleware gates every non-prod host and fails closed without a password. */
export const PASSWORD = 'functions-local';
export const PERSIST = '.wrangler/functions-test';
export const CONFIG = 'tests/functions/wrangler.toml';
export const DATABASE = 'reports-local';
export const DATABASE_ID = '00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000097';

/**
 * Run wrangler's D1 CLI against the local database, and fail loudly with its own words.
 * @param {readonly string[]} args
 * @returns {string} stdout
 */
export function d1(args) {
  const run = spawnSync('npx', ['wrangler', 'd1', 'execute', DATABASE, '--local', '--persist-to', PERSIST, '--config', CONFIG, ...args], { encoding: 'utf8' });
  if (run.status !== 0) throw new Error(`wrangler d1 execute failed (${run.status}): ${run.stderr || run.stdout}`);
  return run.stdout;
}

/**
 * Every stored report whose note is exactly `note`. Each test writes a note
 * of its own, so tests never read each other's rows. The note travels as
 * a SQL string literal, so single quotes are doubled.
 * @param {string} note
 * @returns {Array<{ locale: string, page: string, quote: string, keys: string, suggestion: string, note: string }>}
 */
export function reportsWithNote(note) {
  const literal = `'${note.replaceAll("'", "''")}'`;
  const out = d1(['--json', '--command', `SELECT locale, page, quote, keys, suggestion, note FROM reports WHERE note = ${literal}`]);
  return JSON.parse(out)[0].results;
}
```

      If Task 2 recorded that `wrangler d1 execute` cannot read while `pages
      dev` holds the database, replace `reportsWithNote`'s body with a
      read-only `node:sqlite` open of the one `.sqlite` file under
      `${PERSIST}/v3/d1/`, found by `readdirSync` and asserted to be exactly
      one file.

- [ ] **Step 2: The server.** Create `tests/functions/serve.mjs`:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
/**
 * Build, reset the local D1, apply the real migration, then serve dist/ with
 * the real Functions (#97). Playwright's webServer runs this and waits on
 * /api/report/health, which answers 200 only once the binding AND the
 * migration are in place, so a run cannot start against a bare database.
 */
import { rmSync } from 'node:fs';
import { spawn, spawnSync } from 'node:child_process';
import { DATABASE_ID, PASSWORD, PERSIST, PORT, d1 } from './local.mjs';

const step = (command, args) => {
  const run = spawnSync(command, args, { stdio: 'inherit' });
  if (run.status !== 0) {
    console.error(`${command} ${args.join(' ')} exited ${run.status}`);
    process.exit(run.status ?? 1);
  }
};

rmSync(PERSIST, { recursive: true, force: true });
step('npm', ['run', 'build']);
d1(['--file', 'migrations/0001_reports.sql']);

const server = spawn(
  'npx',
  ['wrangler', 'pages', 'dev', 'dist', '--ip', '127.0.0.1', '--port', String(PORT), '--compatibility-date', '2026-09-01', '--d1', `REPORTS=${DATABASE_ID}`, '--persist-to', PERSIST, '--binding', `DEV_PASSWORD=${PASSWORD}`],
  { stdio: 'inherit' },
);
for (const signal of ['SIGINT', 'SIGTERM']) process.on(signal, () => server.kill(signal));
server.on('exit', (code) => process.exit(code ?? 1));
```

      Use the `--d1` form that Task 2 measured as sharing the store.

- [ ] **Step 3: The config.** Create `playwright.functions.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
import { BASE_URL, PASSWORD } from './tests/functions/local.mjs';

/**
 * The Functions-runtime suite (#97, spec 10): real submissions to the real
 * Pages Functions on workerd, through `wrangler pages dev`. One worker,
 * because every test shares one server and one local database.
 */
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests/functions',
  workers: 1,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  webServer: {
    command: 'node tests/functions/serve.mjs',
    // webServer takes no credentials, and the dev gate answers 401 without
    // them, which Playwright counts as up. So readiness only means "serving";
    // the health test, first in the file with one worker, is what proves the
    // binding and the migration.
    url: `${BASE_URL}/`,
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    timeout: 240_000,
  },
  use: {
    baseURL: BASE_URL,
    colorScheme: 'dark',
    httpCredentials: { username: 'dev', password: PASSWORD, send: 'always' },
  },
  projects: [{ name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } }],
});
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Failing runtime tests.** Create `tests/functions/report.spec.ts`:

```ts
import { randomUUID } from 'node:crypto';
import { test, expect, type Page } from '@playwright/test';
import { getSiteStrings, getStrings } from '../../src/lib/i18n';
import { pagePath } from '../../src/lib/report';
import { reportsWithNote } from './local.mjs';

const vi = getSiteStrings('vi').report;
const tool = getStrings('vi');
const noteFor = (what: string) => `functions test ${what} ${randomUUID()}`;

```

      `tests/functions/` is a new spec directory, so the derived meta-guards
      (`spec-dirs`, `event-collectors`, `evidence-recording`) now read it. If
      `evidence-recording` asks this spec to declare `test.use(recorded)`,
      import `recorded` from `../e2e/evidence` and add it at file level.

- [ ] **Step 5: The script, and run it red.** Add
      `"test:functions": "playwright test --config=playwright.functions.config.ts"`
      to `package.json`'s scripts. The `--config=` form keeps it clear of
      `pipeline-wiring`'s "calling Playwright directly" guard.
      The Function under test already exists (Task 7), so these tests cannot
      be seen red against a stub. Each one is seen red by its own mutation in
      Step 8 instead, one per test. Run them green now:
      Run: `npm run test:functions 2>&1 | tail -20` → 7 passed. Read the
      total: a run that lists fewer tests dropped some.

- [ ] **Step 6: The CI job, guarded first.** Append to the `describe` from
      Task 1 in `tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts`:

```ts
  it('the functions-runtime suite runs in CI and build-and-test needs it', () => {
    const functions = jobNamed('ci.yml', 'functions');
    expect(workflowSteps('ci.yml')).toContain('npm run test:functions');
    expect(jobNamed('ci.yml', 'build-and-test').needs).toContain(functions.id);
  });
```

      Run it: RED (`ci.yml defines no job 'functions'`). Then add to
      `ci.yml`, after `sanity-on-build`, copying the pinned SHAs from the
      neighbouring jobs exactly:

```yaml
  # The real Pages Functions on workerd (#97): `wrangler pages dev` serves
  # this tree's dist/ over a local D1 with the real migration applied, and a
  # browser submits real reports to it. build-and-test needs it, so it gates
  # with no change to branch protection.
  functions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-26.04
    timeout-minutes: 15
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
      - uses: actions/setup-node@820762786026740c76f36085b0efc47a31fe5020 # v7.0.0
        with:
          node-version-file: .nvmrc
          cache: npm
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
      - run: npm run test:functions
      - name: Keep the failing run's Playwright traces
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@043fb46d1a93c77aae656e7c1c64a875d1fc6a0a # v7.0.1
        with:
          name: playwright-traces-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}-functions
          path: test-results/
          retention-days: 14
          if-no-files-found: warn
```

      Change `build-and-test`'s line to `needs: [checks, e2e, sanity-on-build, functions]`.
      Check `WorkflowJob`'s `needs` field name in `tests/workflow-jobs.ts:16`
      before running, and adjust the guard's property access to match it.
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts` → PASS.
      Run: `npm run test:unit 2>&1 | tail -6` → all pass. `unboundedJobFindings`
      and the permissions guards read the new job.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit.**

```bash
git add playwright.functions.config.ts tests/functions package.json .github/workflows/ci.yml tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts
git commit -m "test(report): real submissions on workerd, as a functions job build-and-test needs (Refs #97)"
```

- [ ] **Step 8: See every runtime test red, predicting first, whole file each
      time.** `serve.mjs` rebuilds, so each mutation reaches `dist/` and the
      Function. Restore each with `git checkout -- <file>`, since HEAD is the
      green commit.
      (a) Health: in `serve.mjs`, drop the `d1(['--file', …])` line → RED on
      "the health check sees …" (503, no table).
      (b) Homepage: set `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` in `public/_headers` →
      RED on the homepage submission. The POST's `Origin` is `null`, so
      check 2 refuses it; this is spec 10's `Referrer-Policy` mutation. If
      Task 2 found that `pages dev` ignores `_headers`, this mutation is the
      unit test from Task 2's fallback instead.
      (c) Not-found: in `src/lib/report.ts`, make `matchingKeys` return
      `['site.report.open']` for any non-empty needle → RED on "stores
      nothing".
      (d) Cross-origin: remove the Origin check → RED on the 403.
      (e) Roster: delete `event.preventDefault();` in `report-form.ts` → RED
      on "the roster is still there".
      (f) Double click: delete `if (pending) return;` and both `disabled`
      lines → record whether the double-click test goes RED. If it stays
      green, the post-`sent` reset (which empties a required field) is also
      blocking the second submission. Say so in the PR body, and keep the test
      as the guard of the behaviour a visitor sees.
      (g) Replace: in `showStatus`, change `toggleAttribute('data-shown', match)`
      to `if (match) status.setAttribute('data-shown', '')` → RED on "a later
      outcome replaces the earlier one".
      (h) Pipeline: remove `functions` from `build-and-test.needs` → RED on
      the pipeline guard.

### Task 11: completeness, read from the rendered page

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/e2e/report-completeness.spec.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `reportOptions`, `normalise`, `PAGE_IDS`, `pagePath` (Task 5);
  `catalogueLeaves` (Task 3); `rawCatalogue`, `getSiteStrings`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test.**

```ts
import { test, expect } from './fixtures';
import { recorded } from './evidence';
import { searched } from '../source-files';
import { catalogueLeaves } from '../../src/lib/catalogue-leaves';
import { PREFIXED_LOCALES, getSiteStrings, rawCatalogue, type Locale } from '../../src/lib/i18n';
import { PAGE_IDS, normalise, pagePath, reportOptions } from '../../src/lib/report';
import { isMessageTemplate } from '../../src/lib/i18n/message';

test.use(recorded);

/**
 * Every catalogue string a visitor can see on a page is one that page offers
 * to report (#97, spec 10). Read from the RENDERED DOM after the page's
 * script has run: the tool strings arrive by script, so a static read of the
 * HTML would never find one and pass for nothing (spec review pass 3).
 * Compared by text, not key, because the same words can live under two keys
 * and the visitor picks words.
 */
function plainCatalogueTexts(locale: Locale): string[] {
  const english = new Map(catalogueLeaves(rawCatalogue('en')));
  const tool = catalogueLeaves(rawCatalogue(locale)).filter(([key, value]) => {
    const reference = english.get(key);
    return typeof value === 'string' && !(typeof reference === 'string' && !key.includes('[') && isMessageTemplate(reference));
  });
  const site = catalogueLeaves(getSiteStrings(locale)).filter(([key, value]) => typeof value === 'string' && !key.startsWith('notFound.'));
  return [...new Set([...tool, ...site].map(([, value]) => normalise(value as string, locale)))].filter((text) => text.length > 0);
}

for (const locale of PREFIXED_LOCALES)
  for (const pageId of PAGE_IDS)
    test(`${pagePath(pageId, locale)}: every catalogue string on the page is reportable there`, async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto(pagePath(pageId, locale));
      if (pageId === 'classroom-groups') await page.locator('#cg-students-toggle').click();
      const rendered = await page.evaluate(() => {
        const texts: string[] = [];
        const walker = document.createTreeWalker(document.body, NodeFilter.SHOW_TEXT);
        for (let node = walker.nextNode(); node; node = walker.nextNode()) {
          const parent = node.parentElement;
          if (parent && parent.checkVisibility() && node.textContent?.trim()) texts.push(node.textContent);
        }
        return texts;
      });
      const onPage = new Set(rendered.map((text) => normalise(text, locale)));
      const offered = new Set(reportOptions(pageId, locale).map((option) => normalise(option, locale)));
      const found = plainCatalogueTexts(locale).filter((text) => onPage.has(text));
      const missing = found.filter((text) => !offered.has(text));
      expect(searched(missing, { of: found, what: 'catalogue strings rendered on the page' })).toEqual([]);
    });
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it be live.**
      Run: `npm run build > /dev/null 2>&1; npx playwright test tests/e2e/report-completeness.spec.ts --project=chromium 2>&1 | tail -15` → all pass.
      Then mutate: delete `'glory-points'`'s `siteSection` in `src/lib/report.ts`
      and rebuild. Predict RED on every glory-points test, with `missing`
      naming glory copy, and confirm. For classroom-groups, set its
      `toolCatalogue: false` and predict RED with tool strings named (this
      proves the script-injected strings are read). Restore and confirm green
      on all five engines:
      Run: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/report-completeness.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -8`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit.**

```bash
git add tests/e2e/report-completeness.spec.ts
git commit -m "test(report): every catalogue string on a page is reportable there (Refs #97)"
```

---

### Task 12: the deployed-site checks

**Files:**
- Modify: `tests/dev/dev-sanity.spec.ts`, `tests/prod/prod-sanity.spec.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Dev.** Append to `tests/dev/dev-sanity.spec.ts` (add
      `getSiteStrings` to its imports):

```ts
const PAGES_FUNCTION = {
  tag: '@deployed-only',
  annotation: {
    type: 'deployed-only',
    description: 'the report endpoint is a Pages Function with a D1 binding, and a preview of dist/ runs no Pages Function',
  },
};

test('the report endpoint is bound to its migrated database', PAGES_FUNCTION, async ({ request }) => {
  const response = await request.get('/api/report/health');
  expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
  expect(await response.json()).toEqual({ ok: true });
});

test('a real report from the Vietnamese homepage reaches #report-sent', PAGES_FUNCTION, async ({ page }) => {
  // Writes one row per dev deploy, in the dev database only. The runbook's
  // "automated dev check" statement clears them (docs/runbooks/translation-reports.md).
  const t = getSiteStrings('vi').report;
  await page.goto('/vi/');
  await page.locator('[data-report] summary').click();
  await page.getByLabel(t.quoteLabel, { exact: true }).fill(t.open);
  await page.getByLabel(t.noteLabel, { exact: true }).fill(`automated dev check ${process.env.GITHUB_SHA ?? 'local'}`);
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: t.send }).click();
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\/vi\/#report-sent$/);
  await expect(page.locator('#report-sent')).toBeVisible();
});
```

      `sanity-on-build.test.ts` reads each annotation per test. If it needs the
      object literal inline rather than a shared constant (read its failure
      message), inline it in both tests.

- [ ] **Step 2: Prod.** Append to `tests/prod/prod-sanity.spec.ts`:

```ts
test(
  'the report endpoint is bound to its migrated database',
  {
    tag: '@deployed-only',
    annotation: {
      type: 'deployed-only',
      description: 'the report endpoint is a Pages Function with a D1 binding, and a preview of dist/ runs no Pages Function',
    },
  },
  async ({ request }) => {
    // Health only: automation never writes to the production database.
    const response = await request.get('/api/report/health');
    expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
    expect(await response.json()).toEqual({ ok: true });
  },
);
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the guards and the on-build suites.**
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/sanity-on-build.test.ts tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts` → PASS.
      Run: `npm run test:sanity 2>&1 | tail -10` → PASS, with the three new tests
      left out by `grepInvert`. The deployed runs happen after the merge.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit.**

```bash
git add tests/dev/dev-sanity.spec.ts tests/prod/prod-sanity.spec.ts
git commit -m "test(report): the deployed health checks and one real dev submission (Refs #97)"
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Mutate.** Delete the `annotation` from the prod test → predict
      RED on `sanity-on-build.test.ts`'s "must carry a deployed-only
      annotation". Restore.

---

### Task 13: the visual baselines

The footer grows on beta-locale pages. `home-id` is the only baselined beta page.

- [ ] **Step 1: Find what moved.**
      Run: `npm run test:visual 2>&1 | tail -20` (the pinned container,
      `linux/amd64`, and nothing else running).
      Expected: RED on the four `home-id-*` captures only. Anything else that
      goes red is a finding to explain before recapturing.
- [ ] **Step 2: Recapture those alone.**
      Run: `npm run test:visual:update -- --grep "home-id" 2>&1 | tail -8`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Review old against new by eye** (`git diff --stat`, then open
      both PNGs of each pair). The only change is the footer's closed
      disclosure, one line below the BETA notice.
- [ ] **Step 4: Compare all, writing nothing.**
      Run: `npm run test:visual 2>&1 | tail -8` → all pass, zero written.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
git add tests/e2e/__screenshots__
git commit -m "test(visual): home-id baselines carry the report disclosure (Refs #97)"
```

---

### Task 14: the full gate, the mutation audit, and the PR

- [ ] **Step 1: The AC audit.** Write the table AC → assertion (spec:line)
      → mutation for spec section 12's ACs 2–11 and 13, in the PR body. An
      empty cell is a finding, and it gets fixed before Step 2.
- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the whole mutation list** of spec section 10. Every
      mutation has a row: Tasks 5–11 ran them. List each one with its
      observed RED.
- [ ] **Step 3: The local gates.**
      `npm run format && npm run typecheck && npm run test:unit && npm run test:e2e && npm run test:functions && npm run test:sanity`,
      one at a time, reading each verdict whole. Then check the deployed-site
      suites for any fact this change moved, since they never run before the
      merge: `command grep -rln "footer\|<details\|toHaveCount" tests/dev tests/prod tests/device`,
      and read each hit that counts or measures footer content.
- [ ] **Step 4: Push and open the PR into `develop`.** Check the body with
      `node scripts/closing-keywords.mjs <file> "this pull request body"`. The
      body says `Refs #97` and never puts a closing keyword beside the number.
- [ ] **Step 5: Wait for CI in the background**, then read every job by name
      on the head SHA, read from `gh pr view --json headRefOid` into a file.
- [ ] **Step 6: The merge waits on the operator's Cloudflare setup** (steps
      1–2). Once he confirms, merge with a merge commit, watch the dev deploy,
      read `dev-verified` off the commit and each job by name, close #97 with
      `gh issue close 97`, and move its card to Done on the Shyden Site board
      (`PVT_kwDOEOcG584BiyCS`, title asserted first).
- [ ] **Step 7: File the follow-ups** from spec section 2: the review script
      (each report beside its English source and a back-translation of the
      suggestion); the count-only notification; and the 404's `notFound`
      copy, which has no report route (spec 3.1).

---

## Review log

Each pass runs the mechanical checks, then reads the whole document. The
checks: every path, export and command the plan names exists on
`origin/develop` or is created by a named task; every interface a task
consumes is produced by an earlier task with the same name and type; every
spec section maps to a task; the plan's test code meets this repo's
meta-guards (`evidence-recording`, `viewport-tagging`,
`capture-after-assertion`, `absence-liveness`, `base-url-calls`,
`sanity-on-build`, `pipeline-wiring`); and the file carries no backslash-u
escape.

**Pass 1 (2026-09-26, against `origin/develop` at 9782fa4, merged into this
branch): 14 findings, all fixed.** Checked mechanically: `WorkflowJob.needs`
(`tests/workflow-jobs.ts:18`), Playwright's `TestConfigWebServer` fields,
`HTTPCredentials.send`, `visual.mjs`'s argument forwarding, `dead-copy`'s
matching, and a scan for backslash-u escapes (none; one pattern hit was the
word "succeeding").

1. `playwright.functions.config.ts` gave `webServer` an `httpCredentials`
   field it does not have, so `astro check` would refuse it. Readiness is now
   `/`, and the first test proves the binding.
2. A message made only of slots would match every quote through rule 3, so
   check 8 would accept anything on that page. Clarification 6 now bounds
   rule 3, `matchesForm` is exported so the bound has unit tests, and a
   nonsense-quote test runs over every page and locale.
3. Mutation (f), searching from `at`, could not be observed with `'a1bc'`.
   `'ab1c'` observes it, and a new mutation (g) covers the last slot.
4. The Thai test could index past the last grapheme cluster, and one of its
   assertions tested nothing.
5. "Stores every key" compared sets exactly, although rule 2 can add a key
   whose longer text contains the display.
6. The migration and Function-plumbing tests read raw source. They strip
   comments now, and a mutation keeps a comment in place to prove it.
7. The 320px test measured the page's scroll only. It also measures the form
   against the footer column (CLAUDE.md: "page-level scrollWidth is not
   containment"), with a liveness check by content.
8. Nothing asserted `aria-describedby`. The keyboard test checks both
   accessible descriptions now.
9. `tests/e2e/report-pages.ts` re-exported with an alias for no gain, and a
   `void browserName` line was a placeholder. Both are gone.
10. Task 9 wired the scripts before its e2e test existed, so the test could
    not be seen red. The wiring is now its own step, after the red run.
11. `dead-copy`'s `\.report\b` is satisfied by `from './report-form'`. Task 9
    Step 7 checks what actually guards the section, and fixes the guard if
    nothing does. Task 4's prediction names the group.
12. `local.mjs` had untyped parameters, which `checkJs` refuses.
13. The runtime tests had no red proof. Step 8 now gives each of the seven a
    mutation.
14. The Task 2 spike put two handlers in one file, used an undefined
    `$SCRATCH`, and Task 3's mutation named a file that did not exist yet.
