# Plan: liveness floors are ratcheted (#468)

Refs #468, under the #446 guard audit. Operator decision 2026-10-03, asked
interactively: ratchet the floors. Operator addition the same evening: the
recorder prints how much each floor moved, so a raise is read rather than
rubber-stamped (AC10).

**Built from commits.** Each task below is `git show` of its commit on
`468-floor-ratchet`, fenced with `~~~~`. A review pass applies every task's
diff to `develop` at `4d07565` and refuses unless the result equals the branch
tree, then runs every gate and the matrix on that tree (see Review passes).

## Why

A floor written `toBeGreaterThan(measured - 1)` is tight only on the day it is
measured, because growth never fails it. Measured at `4d07565` by wrapping
`toBeGreaterThan(OrEqual)` across the whole unit suite (446 floor sites, no
test edited): `absence-liveness` was set to `> 420` against a real 421 in #467
and read 424 an hour after it merged; `git-env` 6 slack, `duplicate-imports`
7, `one-test-per-case` and `spec-scan` 1 each, all set tight within two days.
20 of the 58 first-parent commits on `develop` that week changed the number of
files under `tests/`.

## Design

- `tests/floors.json`: id to measured figure. Ids name what is counted
  (`absence-liveness/plain-files`). Its path and the record variable have one
  home, `scripts/record-floors.mjs`, which `tests/floors.ts` imports.
- `tests/floors.ts`, runner-neutral: `floorBreach(id, actual, options?)`
  returns nothing on equality and otherwise the breach as text, so a caller
  writes `expect(floorBreach(id, n)).toBeUndefined()` after its verdict. Below
  the figure: lost units or a real shrink, lowered by hand. Above: grown, run
  the recorder. Not a whole non-negative number: refused in both modes. In
  record mode (`FLOORS_RECORD` set) it appends `{ id, actual, site }`. Judging
  is an explicit `record: null`, because an explicit `undefined` takes the
  environment default (found by running the recorder for real).
- `scripts/record-floors.mjs` (`npm run floors:record`): runs the unit suite
  in record mode, then `decideRecord` checks everything before writing
  anything: never lowers, refuses a stale id, an id from two places or with
  two values, and a failing run. Refuses under `CI`. `describeMoves` prints
  every move with its delta, largest first (AC10).
- `tests/literal-floors.ts`: classifies every `toBeGreaterThan(OrEqual)` under
  `tests/`, every comparison with a literal inside an `expect` argument, and
  every `toBeLessThan(OrEqual)` whose subject is a literal (a floor written
  backwards, added at review pass 1) as presence, counted, forwarded,
  compared, threshold or ceiling, and refuses anything else by line.
- `tests/unit/literal-floors.test.ts`: a counted or forwarded floor is
  refused unless it is a product value with its reason, or one of the seven
  Playwright floors #446 Group 5 ratchets (that list may only shrink).
  Controls: (a) the sites inside the verdict; (b) its own count ratcheted;
  (c) per file, the matcher counted in comment-stripped text, less what
  string and regex literals spell, equals what the reader returned; (d)
  refusals; (e) every form planted by hand. Every recorded id is spelled
  exactly once under `tests/`.

## Acceptance criteria to evidence

| AC | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| 1 ids and figures in `tests/floors.json` | Task 1, Task 2; narrowed to the number only (comment on #468) |
| 2 runner-neutral check, two messages | Task 1: `floors.test.ts` pins each message whole; Task 9 gives its constants one home |
| 3 recorder, everything checked before any write, CI never records | Task 1 (`decideRecord`, `script-entry` probe), Task 3 (no workflow runs it); matrix R8-R12, R16, R17; each pass runs the recorder on the applied tree |
| 4 every unit liveness floor converted, after its verdict | Task 2: 43 floors, `spec-scan`'s helper and five callers, four locales, `evidence-recording`'s two comparisons; 16 moved below their verdict |
| 5 meta-guard refusing a literal floor in every form | Task 2, Task 7; matrix R18-R25, R29 |
| 6 every id used by exactly one site | Task 2 ('spells every recorded id exactly once'); `decideRecord` refuses an id from two places at record time; matrix R10, R28 |
| 7 matrix on both trees | below |
| 8 ledger and CLAUDE.md | Task 4; the global rule's control (b) is edited outside the repo |
| 9 plan reviewed by running it | Review passes, Pass log |
| 10 every move printed with its delta | Task 1 (`describeMoves`); matrix R12 |

## Task 1: The check, the recorder, and absence-liveness's three floors

TDD: 20 tests run RED against throwing stubs, none passed; then green. Running the recorder for real found two defects its unit tests could not: an explicit `undefined` meant "not recording" and took the environment default, and the stack-frame regex spelled `\/\/`, which one-home reads as a comment stripper. AC10 (printed moves) was added here at the operator's word, RED first (3 as predicted). First record: 424 -> 426, 262 -> 264, 113 -> 114, each equal to what the commit added.

## Task 2: Every unit liveness floor ratcheted, and the literal-floor meta-guard

The reader was written test-first (20 RED against a stub), then run over `tests/` to derive the population: 78 floors demanding two or more, 59 in the unit suite (43 to ratchet, 16 product values), 19 outside it (12 product values, 7 for Group 5). Converted by an AST script that asserted every edit applied; 16 moved below their verdict. Comparison floors were planted RED (5) after the stale-comment sweep found `evidence-recording`'s. New files were `git add -N`ed before recording, so the tracked-file guards saw them. Every first figure was read against the census at `4d07565`.

+/**
+ * How a `toBeGreaterThan(OrEqual)` bound is written (#468).
+ *
+ * A liveness floor written as a literal is tight only on the day it is
+ * measured: growth never fails it, so `absence-liveness` sat 22 under its real
+ * count within a day, and 3 under it an hour after it was re-measured. Every
+ * floor that demands two or more therefore goes through the ratchet in
+ * `tests/floors.ts`, or is a product value with its reason written down
+ * (`literal-floors.test.ts`). This reader finds them however they are written:
+ *
+ * - `presence`: the bound demands at most one (`> 0`, `>= 1`), which is what
+ *   `searched()` already demands of every population;
+ * - `counted`: a whole-number literal demanding two or more, the shape every
+ *   drifted floor had;
+ * - `forwarded`: the bound is a parameter of an enclosing function, or a
+ *   property of one, so the number lives at the call site (`spec-scan.ts`'s
+ *   `liveness.moreThan` was this, and no literal search could see it);
+ * - `compared`: a value computed in place (`prod > dev`, an index order);
+ * - `threshold`: a fractional literal, a bound on a measure (a contrast of
+ *   4.5), which is never a count;
+ * - `ceiling`: negated, so it bounds from above and is no floor.

 - **Page-level `scrollWidth` is not containment.** Content can overflow a _card_ by 34.5px and produce zero document scroll — which is exactly how the Remove button shipped hanging out of the Student details border at every laptop width. Assert against the offending element's own container (`nothing in the roster escapes its card`), not just `document.documentElement`.
 - **A hand-written list of things to check will miss the one that breaks.** The no-horizontal-scroll tests opened `#cg-grouping-toggle` and `#cg-sound-toggle` — added one at a time as each section gained content — and never `#cg-io-toggle`, the only section holding a native `<input type="file">`. Its ~344px intrinsic minimum propagated up `#cg-form`'s grid (items default to `min-width: auto`) and pinned the track to 378px at every viewport: 5px of horizontal scroll at 390px, **74px at 320px**. `max-width: 100%` does not fix this — the automatic minimum reads the element's min-content size, which `max-width` does not change; an explicit `width` replaces it. The replacement test _derives_ every disclosure from the DOM, so a section added later is covered the day it appears.
 - **A guard you have not watched fail is not a guard.** This repo has shipped two that asserted nothing, and both read as correct on the page. The supply-chain sub-path check (#23) was satisfied by `dependabot.yml`'s own **comment** describing the group it was meant to require — no group configured, suite green. #21 Stage 4's first replacement for the prod-smoke path list used `prod.includes(path)`, and `/glory-points` is a substring of `/id/glory-points`: the English assertion passed on the **Indonesian** path, and mutating a path to `/id/glory-pointsXX` left it green because that still contains the needle. **Every guard asserting against source text, config, or a workflow file is mutation-verified in BOTH directions before it lands** — break the thing it protects and watch it fail, then restore it and watch it pass. Strip comments before matching, so the file's documentation cannot satisfy its own guard. Prefer an exact set comparison to a substring test, and assert ORDER where order carries meaning (Dependabot stops at the first matching group). Presence is not the assertion; failure is. **And a mutation that comes back GREEN where you predicted RED has three causes, not one** (#250): the guard is weak, the mutation never reached `dist/`, or the medium made the mutation impossible. A RED is self-proving — the test failed BECAUSE of the change — so only a GREEN needs the built-output check, and that check belongs on the OBSERVED verdict rather than the predicted one, since a wrong prediction is exactly when it is needed. Rule out "never landed" by asserting the mutation's shape in the built bytes (for a REMOVAL, assert the absence WITH a liveness probe beside it, or an empty file list satisfies it for free), and rule out "weak guard" by probing the assertion's own liveness. What remains is an illegal mutation: `max-height: 40px !important` can never shrink a control, because CSS resolves a box as `max(min-height, min(max-height, height))` and a 44px `min-height` beats any smaller max-height however important it is.
+- **A liveness floor is a recorded figure, checked for equality (#468).** A floor written `toBeGreaterThan(measured - 1)` is tight only on the day it is measured, because growth never fails it: `absence-liveness` read 424 an hour after it was set to `> 420`. So a guard proves it read its population with `expect(floorBreach('<id>', count)).toBeUndefined()` (`tests/floors.ts`), placed after its verdict, against the figure in `tests/floors.json`: one unit short fails, and so does one more. When a change grows a population, `npm run floors:record` raises the figure and prints every floor that moved; read each delta against your diff, because a raise smaller than the units you added is a reader that lost some, and put the lines in the commit. It never lowers a figure: a real shrink is a hand edit with the reason in the commit. CI never records. `literal-floors.test.ts` refuses a literal floor demanding two or more, however it is written (a matcher, a parameter, `n > 25` inside an `expect`), unless it bounds a product value and says so. A new test file grows several floors at once, and a new file is invisible to the tracked-file guards until `git add -N`, so add it before recording.
 - **No message may put a closing keyword next to an issue number — not even one you mean.** `close`/`fix`/`resolve` and their inflections, beside `#<n>`, are refused in a commit message (`.githooks/commit-msg`) and in a pull request body (`.github/workflows/pr-body.yml`), both through one home: `scripts/closing-keywords.mjs`. GitHub's parser has no model of negation, tense or intent, and it has retired an issue here **twice** — once from a sentence in capitals saying the issue must stay open, once from a body promising to retire it by hand later. There is deliberately **no exception**, because no such keyword appears in the last 300 commit bodies or 40 pull request bodies: the capability an exception would preserve has never been used, and an allowance branch nothing exercises is the vacuity #118 was filed about. Write `Refs #<n>`, and retire an issue with `gh issue close <n>` once the work is verified. Check a body before it reaches GitHub with `node scripts/closing-keywords.mjs <file> "this pull request body"`. The workflow re-runs on `edited` — a body edited after a green run is how such a sentence gets written — and is **not a gate** until `closing-keywords` joins `required_status_checks.contexts`, which is repository administration and so the operator's (#278).
 - **Locale files are a review surface.** Every catalogue is typed `Catalogue`, so `npm run typecheck` (`astro check`, run in CI) fails on a missing key; it cannot read copy, so tests hold the rest. `tests/unit/i18n.test.ts` and `dead-copy.test.ts`: blank values, untranslated copy, copy no page renders. `locale-fallbacks.test.ts`: English left in zh, vi and th. `message-parity.test.ts`: every language fills the slots English fills, offers the choices it offers, and has exactly its own plural forms. `label-check.test.ts` and `verified-labels.test.ts`: a label of three words or fewer is checked against its own locale's copy that uses its English and says more, and one that disagrees, or that a namesake renders in other words, is either pinned or listed as awaiting the operator's read (#161). A label can be translated, non-blank and slot-perfect and still name the wrong thing: `Tình dục` passed every other guard here for a month. Messages are templates (#136) — English decides which entries are messages — and zh/vi/th wording is a DeepL draft until a speaker has reviewed it.

+## The ratchet (#468), done
+
+A floor at measured − 1 is tight only on the day it is measured: growth
+never fails it. `absence-liveness` was set to `> 420` against a real 421 in
+#467 and read 424 an hour after it merged, and a recorder wrapped round
+`toBeGreaterThan(OrEqual)` across the unit suite at `4d07565` found
+`git-env` 6 slack, `duplicate-imports` 7, `one-test-per-case` and
+`spec-scan` 1, all set tight within two days. 20 of the 58 first-parent
+commits on `develop` that week changed the number of files under `tests/`.
+
+So every liveness floor is now a figure in `tests/floors.json`, checked for
+equality by `floorBreach` (`tests/floors.ts`): one unit short fails, and so
+does one more, until `npm run floors:record` raises it. The recorder checks
+everything before writing anything and refuses a figure that would fall
+(lowering is a hand edit with the reason in the commit), an id no test
+asserted, an id asserted from two places or with two values, and a failing
+run; CI never records. It prints every floor that moved, largest first,
+because a raise is accepted on its direction alone: a change that adds five
+units while its reader loses three records +2 (operator, 2026-10-03). #469
+gives each guard the number-free cross-check that catches that mechanically.
+
+`literal-floors.test.ts` keeps it that way. Its reader classifies every
+`toBeGreaterThan(OrEqual)` under `tests/`, and every comparison with a
+literal inside an `expect` argument, as presence, counted, forwarded,
+compared, threshold or ceiling, and refuses anything else by line. A
+counted or forwarded floor must be ratcheted, or listed as a product value
+with its reason (a 44px target, a grouping statistic), or be one of the
+seven Playwright floors Group 5 ratchets (that list may only shrink). Its
+cross-check counts the matcher per file in the comment-stripped text, less
+what string and regex literals spell; no number drifts in it.
+
+Converted: 43 unit floors, `spec-scan`'s helper (whose number was a
+parameter, which no literal search sees) and its five callers,
+`back-translate`'s four locales, and `evidence-recording`'s two floors
+written as `acting.length > 25` inside a `toEqual`, which the reader first
+missed and now plants. Sixteen sat before their verdict in the same test
+and were moved below it, so a population that grew never hides a finding.
+Each first figure was read against the census and the diff that recorded

+The matrix ran 34 rows, all as predicted once R22 was corrected. On
+`develop`, 6 stayed GREEN: a reader one short in `absence-liveness`,
+`git-env`, `duplicate-imports` and `spec-scan`'s forwarded floor, and growth
+through `absence-liveness` and `evidence-recording`'s comparison floor. On the
+branch, 28 turned their guard RED: those six again, `back-translate`'s looped
+locale, the recorder's four refusals and its printed moves, both directions
+of the check, record mode's call site, the CI refusal's words, a workflow
+running the recorder, and eleven against the literal reader (a literal floor
+back, a forwarded bound, the comparison form, a callback's predicate, a
+literal read as written, `expect.poll`, the cross-check alone with its floor
+off, a root skipped, a stale product value, a growing Group 5 list, an id
+spelled twice). R22 first came back GREEN: TypeScript already normalises a
+numeric literal's text, so the `replace` it removed was dead code, and is
+gone. The CI refusal is mutated in its words, not removed, because a
+recorder that ran under the probe would run the suite and could rewrite the

## Task 7: From review pass 1: a floor written backwards is read

Pass 1 finding 1, by reading: `expect(5).toBeLessThan(n)` names the count as the bound, which the reader did not see. No file writes one (measured: 0 literal subjects with a less-than matcher, known positive 2 literal subjects). Planted RED first (2), then read. Matrix row R29.

## Mutation matrix

`.superpowers/sdd/floors/m468.py`, copied from #446 Group 3's runner,
vitest only. Every anchor must occur exactly once; a run that cannot start is
NOT-RUN and a target naming no test is ABSENT, never GREEN. The whole file
runs per row. A row is predicted for one tree: develop holds literal floors
where the branch holds `floorBreach`, so each pair is two rows.

| Id | Mutation | `develop` | branch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 / R1 | `absence-liveness` reads one site short | GREEN | RED |
| D2 / R2 | its population grew by one | GREEN | RED |
| D3 / R3 | `git-env`'s child run reads one test short | GREEN | RED |
| D4 / R4 | `duplicate-imports` reads one import short | GREEN | RED |
| D5 / R5 | `spec-scan`'s forwarded floor reads one short | GREEN | RED |
| D6 / R6 | `evidence-recording`'s comparison floor grew by one | GREEN | RED |
| R7 | `back-translate`, a looped locale, reads one short | — | RED |
| R8 | the recorder lets a figure fall | — | RED |
| R9 | it keeps a stale id | — | RED |
| R10 | it accepts an id from two places | — | RED |
| R11 | it accepts an id reading two values | — | RED |
| R12 | its moves leave out a new id | — | RED |
| R13 | growth passes the check | — | RED |
| R14 | a short reader passes the check | — | RED |
| R15 | record mode loses the call site | — | RED |
| R16 | the CI refusal stops naming itself | — | RED |
| R17 | a workflow runs the recorder | — | RED |
| R18 | a literal floor comes back (`spec-dirs`) | — | RED |
| R19 | a forwarded bound reads as compared | — | RED |
| R20 | a comparison floor is unread | — | RED |
| R21 | a callback's predicate reads as a floor | — | RED |
| R22 | a numeric literal is read as written | — | RED |
| R23 | `expect.poll` is not a root | — | RED |
| R24 | the cross-check alone: the reader blind to `OrEqual`, its floor off | — | RED |
| R25 | an unreadable root is skipped | — | RED |
| R26 | a product value outlives its floor | — | RED |
| R27 | the Group 5 list grows | — | RED |
| R28 | a recorded id is spelled twice | — | RED |
| R29 | a floor written backwards is unread (review pass 1) | — | RED |

35 rows: 6 on `develop`, 29 on the branch. R16 mutates the refusal's words,
not the refusal: a recorder that ran under the probe would run the suite and
could rewrite the real `tests/floors.json`.

## Review passes

`.superpowers/sdd/floors/p468-pass.sh <n>` copies the tools into `pass<n>.d/`
and runs from that snapshot. It resets `../shyden.co.uk-468-pass` to
`4d07565`, applies each task's diff from THIS document with `git apply`,
commits each, and refuses unless the applied tree equals the branch tree
(this document aside). Then: `astro check` (three summary lines, all 0),
`prettier --check .`, the whole unit suite, `npm run floors:record` on the
applied tree (it must report that every floor already matches and leave the
tree clean), and the matrix on `develop` and on the applied tree. After the
script, the pass reads the whole document. The loop ends at a pass that finds
nothing.

## Pass log

### Pass 1 (2026-10-03, 20:58Z, tree `bd640c8`)

Mechanical, by `p468-pass.sh 1`: the six task diffs applied to `4d07565`
equal the branch; `astro check` 0/0/0; prettier clean; unit 3592/3592;
`npm run floors:record` on the applied tree: every floor already matches,
tree clean; matrix 6 + 28 as predicted, 0 mismatches. CLEAN.

Reading: the head, every task note, the matrix, review and log sections,
and `tests/literal-floors.ts` in its final form. (Pass 2 corrected this line,
which first claimed the whole document: Task 2's migration diff was not read
line by line.)

1. A floor written backwards, `expect(5).toBeLessThan(files.length)`, puts
   the count in the bound, and the reader saw only `toBeGreaterThan(OrEqual)`
   and comparisons, so it passed the meta-guard unclassified. Measured: no
   file under `tests/` writes one (0 literal subjects with a less-than
   matcher; the probe's known positive, any literal subject, found 2), and
   no file imports `node:assert` or writes chai's `should`/`assert`. Fixed
   (Task 7): read and planted, a ceiling on a count stays no floor; matrix
   row R29; the ledger counts 35 rows (Task 8).

One finding; the loop continues.

### Pass 2 (2026-10-03, 21:03Z, tree `86011d0`)

Mechanical, by `p468-pass.sh 2`: the eight task diffs applied to `4d07565`
equal the branch; `astro check` 0/0/0; prettier clean; unit 3595/3595;
`npm run floors:record` on the applied tree: every floor already matches,
tree clean; matrix 6 + 29 as predicted, 0 mismatches. CLEAN.

Reading: the head, every task note, the matrix, review and log sections,
and in their final form `tests/unit/literal-floors.test.ts` (lists, verdict,
controls) and `scripts/record-floors.mjs` (`main`).

2. Pass 1's log claimed it read the whole document; it read the sections
   above and one module. Corrected in place.
3. The Design bullet for `tests/literal-floors.ts` wrapped raggedly after
   pass 1's edit. Rewrapped.
4. The cross-check's comment in `literal-floors.test.ts` held one line far
   past the margin. Rewrapped (Task 9).
5. `FLOORS_FILE` and `FLOORS_RECORD` were spelled in two homes,
   `tests/floors.ts` and `scripts/record-floors.mjs`: two copies drift. The
   recorder holds both and `floors.ts` imports them (Task 9).
6. A recorder whose `npx` cannot start refused with `exit null`, naming the
   symptom; it now refuses with the spawn error (Task 9).

Five findings; the loop continues.
