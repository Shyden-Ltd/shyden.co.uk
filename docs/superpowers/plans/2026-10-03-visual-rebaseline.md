# Automated Visual Rebaseline Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** When Dependabot updates Playwright and nothing else and the new browsers move pixels, recapture exactly the failed baselines, commit them to the pull request, run CI there, and hold the merge with a required check until the operator has approved the PNG diff.

**Architecture:** One script, `scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs`, holds every decision as a pure, unit-tested function, plus a thin `main` that reads files and calls GitHub. An unprivileged `pull_request` workflow qualifies the PR, reruns the gate in the gate's own image and uploads the recaptured PNGs with a manifest. A privileged `workflow_run` workflow runs only default-branch code: it refuses until `develop` requires the lock, validates the upload, commits it through the Git Data API, dispatches `ci.yml` and comments. `ci.yml` gains `workflow_dispatch`. The lock is a second script, `scripts/operator-review.mjs` (a pure `reviewVerdict` and a thin `main`), run by `operator-review.yml` from the default branch on every pull request and after every review, which a relay workflow with no permissions starts; the workflow posts the verdict as the commit status `operator-review`.

**Tech Stack:** Node 24 ESM with JSDoc types (checked by `astro check`), Vitest, `yaml` (already a dev dependency), GitHub Actions, the GitHub REST API through `fetch`.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-visual-rebaseline-design.md` (reviewed to zero in 24 passes; decision 4 and Unit 4 added in passes 19-24). Read it before any task.

## Global Constraints

- Acts only for pull requests opened by `dependabot[bot]`, from this repository, level with `develop`, that update Playwright and nothing else (operator decision 3, 2026-10-03).
- The gate (`ci.yml` job `visual`) never rewrites what it checks: `playwright.config.ts` keeps `updateSnapshots: 'none'` (pinned at `browser-matrix.test.ts:331`), and no `ci.yml` job passes `--update-snapshots`.
- No new secret: the commit uses the job's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and CI on the new head starts by dispatching `ci.yml` (operator decision 2).
- A bot rebaseline merges only once the operator has approved it at its current head, and a required check enforces that (operator decision 4, Unit 4). Nothing commits a rebaseline until `develop` requires that check (Task 10), and requiring it is the operator's, after the merge (Task 11).
- No retries anywhere (operator rule 2026-10-02). Every network call has a time limit; whatever does not arrive fails by name.
- The job that runs pull-request code holds a read-only token and no secrets. The job that writes never checks out, installs or runs pull-request code, and never executes anything from the artifact.
- Every third-party action is pinned to a full SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment, using the SHAs already in `ci.yml`.
- One test per case: a population known before the run is generated as one test each, never looped inside one test (global rule 2026-10-02).
- Every guard counts the unit it judges, with a floor at the measured figure minus one, and is mutation-verified RED and restored GREEN (global rule 2026-10-02).
- No closing keyword beside an issue number in any commit or PR body: write `Refs #459`.
- Merge into `develop` with a merge commit, never a squash.

## Review Focus

1. **A future Playwright rewords its screenshot error.** A reasonable person expects the run to fail by name rather than misread it. The baseline path comes from the `-expected.png` attachment, which Playwright points at the committed file (measured on 1.63.0). The message is consulted only for `toHaveScreenshot` on its first line and for an optional pixel count. Task 2 pins a report with no count (kept, with `pixels: null`) and a report with no diff attachment (refused).
2. **The macOS temp directory is a symlink** (`/var` → `/private/var`), so the CLI tests' `cwd()` would not match the paths written into a fixture. Task 4 resolves every temp dir with `realpathSync` before writing paths into a report.
3. **An artifact entry name carrying a newline or `::`** would inject a workflow command if echoed raw. Every artifact-derived string in an error is `JSON.stringify`-quoted and cut to 120 characters (Task 3 pins one).
4. **A downgrade is how the proof sets an older, drifting release.** A person would expect it to qualify like an upgrade. Task 1 pins it.
5. **A rename into `package.json`** must never pass as a dependency file. Task 4's `qualify` command records a renamed file as `old → new`, which matches no allowed path, and Task 1 pins that.
6. **A rebaseline renamed away.** A bot commit that moves a screenshot out of `tests/e2e/__screenshots__/` changed a screenshot as surely as one that edits it. Task 8's `verdict` command reads each file's `previous_filename` as well as its `filename`, so either side locks.
7. **A review on a pull request from a fork.** GitHub fills `workflow_run.pull_requests` only for a head in this repository, so the trusted half refuses that run by name and the status stays as the fork's last `pull_request_target` run set it. Task 1 refuses a fork, so no rebaseline can be on one; the cost is a red relay-started run, never a lock that opens.

## Measurement deferred (operator decision, 2026-10-03)

The spec's first planned task, finding a Playwright release that drifts, was deferred by the operator (recorded on #459, comment 5966311423). The throwaway harness from run 37099208646 now fails the pre-push unit suite on two #454 guards. Only 1.45.3 to 1.58.2 can be measured, because CI renders only in noble images. Task 12 does the search with the shipped capture workflow itself, after the merge, so no experiment workflow and no hook skip are needed.

## Where the plan departs from the spec

- **The recapture is detected by hash, not `git diff`.** The spec has the capture take `git diff --name-only` after recapturing. The capture job runs in the Playwright container, where the checkout belongs to another user and `git` refuses it as unsafe unless `safe.directory` is configured. Instead, `classify` records each failed baseline's sha256 before the recapture, and `buildManifest` refuses any whose bytes did not change. The contract is the spec's own: the files kept are exactly the screenshots the gate failed, and a gate-failed screenshot that did not change is a contradiction that fails the job.
- **The manifest is bound to the run that made it.** Beyond the spec's pattern checks, `validateArtifact` refuses a manifest whose PR number or head SHA differs from the triggering run's own `workflow_run` facts, so an artifact cannot speak for another pull request.
- **The workflow posts the `operator-review` status, not the script.** The spec has `operator-review.yml` run only `node scripts/operator-review.mjs`. Here the script decides and writes step outputs, and `gh api` steps (preinstalled on the runner, so still nothing installed) post each status, as `deploy-dev.yml` posts `dev-verified`. `pipeline-wiring`'s *documents only a context something in this repository can report* derives the contexts a workflow can report from job names and from `-f context=<name>` in its run lines (`producibleContexts`); a status posted by `fetch` inside a script is invisible to it, so `CLAUDE.md` naming the lock as a check to require would be refused. The guard keeps its one recognised form, and the order the spec sets (pending on the event's head before any read, pending on the current head, then the verdict) is kept as steps.
- **The `locked?` check is its own step**, `node scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs locked`, before the download and the commit, so a wiring guard can read its order and its condition from the parsed workflow rather than from the script's control flow.

## Files

- Create `scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs`: pure decisions (Tasks 1-3, and `lockRequired` in Task 10) and `main` (Tasks 4 and 10).
- Create `tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts`: the pure functions (Tasks 1-3 and 10).
- Create `tests/unit/visual-rebaseline-cli.test.ts`: `classify` and `stage` against real files (Task 4).
- Modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: the `workflow_dispatch` trigger (Task 5).
- Create `.github/workflows/visual-rebaseline.yml`: capture (Task 6).
- Create `.github/workflows/visual-rebaseline-commit.yml`: commit (Task 7), and its `locked` step (Task 10).
- Create `scripts/operator-review.mjs` and `tests/unit/operator-review.test.ts`: the lock's verdict (Task 8).
- Create `.github/workflows/operator-review.yml` and `.github/workflows/operator-review-relay.yml`: the lock (Task 9).
- Modify `tests/unit/script-entry.test.ts`: register both scripts (Tasks 4 and 8), and the new command (Task 10).
- Modify `tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts`: two trigger pins (Task 5), the `--update-snapshots` guard (Task 6), the new guards (Tasks 6, 7, 9 and 10).
- Modify `CLAUDE.md`: the rebaseline paragraph and the lock that holds its merge (Task 11).
- Delete `.github/workflows/probe-459.yml` and `.github/workflows/probe-459-relay.yml`, the throwaway measurement merged in #460 (Task 11).

### How a review pass runs this plan

Every code block below sits under a marker that `.superpowers/sdd/459/assemble.py` applies in order: `create` writes a new file, `append` adds to one, and `edit` replaces an OLD block that must match exactly once with a NEW one. A review pass assembles the plan onto a scratch worktree of this branch, then runs `npx prettier --check .`, `npx astro check` and `npx vitest run` there, plus every mutation the tasks predict.

---

### Task 1: Qualify a pull request

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs`
- Create: `tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `qualify(pr: PullRequestFacts): { qualifies: true, versions: string } | { qualifies: false, reason: string }`, which throws on a truncated file list. `PullRequestFacts` is `{ author, headRepo, baseRepo, files: string[], changedFiles, behindBy, base: Side, head: Side }`, and `Side` is `{ lock: string, pkg: string, dockerfile: string | null }`. Also `DEPENDABOT`, `LABEL` and `ARTIFACT`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

<!-- create: tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts -->
```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import { qualify } from '../../scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs';

/**
 * The visual rebaseline (#459) and the decisions it makes. Fixtures are
 * written here, never imported from the code under test.
 */

/**
 * #26's real lockfile entries (c6af312, @playwright/test 1.61.1 to 1.63.0),
 * copied verbatim. The bump changed the root devDependency, these three
 * entries, and REMOVED `node_modules/playwright/node_modules/fsevents`, so a
 * rule naming only the three entries would have refused the one real
 * Playwright update this repository has had.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests against a throwing stub, and watch each fail on its own assertion**

Create the script with `export function qualify() { throw new Error('not implemented'); }` and the three constants, then run:

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts`
Expected: 23 failed, 0 passed. 22 fail on `not implemented`, and `throws on a truncated file list` fails because the stub's message is not the one it names. A test that PASSES here is vacuous, so fix it before going on.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

<!-- create: scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs -->
```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
/**
 * Rebaselines the visual gate for a Dependabot Playwright update (#459).
 *
 * A Playwright release ships new browsers, and new browsers can move pixels
 * while the site is unchanged. For a pull request Dependabot opened that
 * updates Playwright and nothing else, `visual-rebaseline.yml` reruns the
 * gate, recaptures exactly the screenshots it failed and uploads them, and
 * `visual-rebaseline-commit.yml` validates that upload, commits it to the
 * branch, starts CI there and labels the pull request for the operator's
 * review. Any other update keeps a red `visual` for a person to diagnose
 * (operator, 2026-10-03: "we cannot afford to allow any visual bugs go
 * unnoticed and unfixed"). Design:
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-visual-rebaseline-design.md.
 *
 * Every decision is a pure function here, unit-tested in
 * tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts. `main` only reads files and calls
 * GitHub: one request at a time, each with a time limit, never a retry
 * (operator rule, 2026-10-02), so whatever does not arrive fails by name.
 *

| # | Mutation | Predicted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | `inPlaywrightTree`: drop the `` `${tree}/` `` branch | RED: #26 (nested fsevents) and the downgrade |
| Q2 | `inPlaywrightTree`: `startsWith(tree)` with no slash | RED: lookalike `playwright-extra` |
| Q3 | `lockOutsidePlaywright`: skip the root entry entirely | RED: Astro, root-entry change |
| Q4 | `dockerfileOutsideFrom`: return `undefined` always | RED: the FROM-pin test |
| Q5 | `qualify`: drop the `behindBy` check | RED: behind its base |
| Q6 | `qualify`: drop the `moved.length === 0` check | RED: Dockerfile-only |

### Task 2: Read the gate's report and build the manifest

**Files:**
- Modify: `scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs`
- Modify: `tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from Task 1.
- Produces: `testsIn(report): { title: string, results: any[] }[]`, which counts both a report and a `--list` listing. `failedBaselines(report, listed: number, root: string): FailedBaseline[]`, where `FailedBaseline` is `{ path: string, pixels: number | null }`. `gateAgrees(exitCode: number, failed: readonly FailedBaseline[]): void`. `buildManifest({ pr, headSha, playwright, failed, contentOf }): Manifest`, where each `failed` item also carries `before` (the committed file's sha256), and `Manifest` is `{ pr, headSha, playwright, files: { path, sha256, bytes, pixels }[] }`. `sha256(content: Uint8Array): string`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

<!-- edit: tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts -->
```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import { qualify } from '../../scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs';

  failedBaselines,
  gateAgrees,
  qualify,
  testsIn,
} from '../../scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs';
```

<!-- append: tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts -->

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them against throwing stubs**

Add `testsIn`, `failedBaselines`, `gateAgrees` and `buildManifest` as `throw new Error('not implemented')` stubs.

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts`
Expected: Task 1's 23 pass, and every new test (24) fails. `accepts a clean exit` and `accepts a red exit` fail because the stub throws.

git commit -m "visual-rebaseline: read the gate's report and build the manifest (Refs #459)"
```

| # | Mutation | Predicted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | `failedBaselines`: drop `listed <= 0` | RED: empty listing (the counts agree at 0) |
| R2 | `screenshotFailure`: `expected.length < 1` instead of `!== 1`, and drop `errors.length !== 1` | RED: two screenshot comparisons, and nothing else (the missing baseline and the ordinary failure have no expected image) |
| R3 | `screenshotFailure`: drop the diff check | RED: no diff image |
| R4 | `plain`: return the text unchanged | RED: the error outside any test, whose message is coloured where the expected text is not. The pixel failure stays GREEN, because the colour codes wrap `toHaveScreenshot` without splitting it. |
| R5 | `testsIn`: do not walk child suites | RED: nested count, and every report test |
| R6 | `buildManifest`: drop the unchanged check | RED: recapture left unchanged |

### Task 3: Validate the artifact, and write what the commit says

**Files:**
- Modify: `scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs`
- Modify: `tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `sha256`, `BASELINE`, the `Manifest` typedef (Task 2).
- Produces: `validateArtifact({ entries, run, headPaths }): { manifest: Manifest, files: { path: string, content: Uint8Array }[] }`, where `entries` is `{ name: string, kind: 'file' | 'directory' | 'other', content?: Uint8Array }[]` and `run` is `{ pr: number, headSha: string }`. `dispatchable(workflow: unknown): boolean`. `commentBody(manifest, commitSha: string): string`. `commitMessage(manifest): string`. `MAX_PNG_BYTES`.

| V2 | drop the `headPaths` check | RED: adds no file |
| V3 | drop `entry.kind !== 'file' \|\|` | RED: the symlink that carries bytes |
| V4 | skip the signature check | RED: not a PNG |
| V5 | `quoted` returns `String(value)` | RED: the newline test |
| V6 | `dispatchable`: `return true` | RED: without it, commented out |

### Task 4: The commands that read files and call GitHub

**Files:**
- Modify: `scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs`
- Create: `tests/unit/visual-rebaseline-cli.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: every export from Tasks 1-3.
- Produces: `main(args?: string[]): Promise<void>` and the five commands. `qualify` reads `PR_NUMBER`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, and writes `qualifies=true|false` to `GITHUB_OUTPUT`. `classify <gate.json> <list.json>` reads `GATE_EXIT`, writes `failed.json` and `failed=<n>`. `stage <dir>` reads `failed.json`, `PR_NUMBER` and `HEAD_SHA`, and writes `<dir>/manifest.json` with the files beside it. `find` reads `RUN_ID` and writes `present=true|false`. `commit` reads `RUN_PR`, `RUN_HEAD_SHA` and `ARTIFACT_DIR`. `entriesUnder(root: string): Entry[]` is exported for the CLI test. Every command appends its report to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` when that is set, and prints `::error::<reason>` and exits 1 on a refusal.

The network commands (`qualify`, `find`, `commit`, and Task 10's `locked`) are proved on the real runner in Task 12. They talk only to GitHub, and a stand-in for GitHub would test the stand-in. The file commands are proved here against real files.

- [ ] **Step 3b: Register the script with the guards that inventory scripts**

`script-entry.test.ts` runs every script that decides with `import.meta.main`, using an input it refuses. With no command, this one refuses by name:

<!-- edit: tests/unit/script-entry.test.ts -->
```ts
  // The three that did all their work at module scope until #276. Each refuses
```
```ts
  // With no command it does nothing it could report, so it refuses by name
  // before reading a file or calling GitHub (#459).
  'visual-rebaseline.mjs': {
    args: [],
    status: 1,
    says: 'unknown command (none); expected qualify, classify, stage, find or commit',
  },
  // The three that did all their work at module scope until #276. Each refuses
```

`one-home.test.ts` keeps directory walking in `tests/source-files.ts`. The artifact walk is a second home on purpose, with the reason beside it:

<!-- edit: tests/unit/one-home.test.ts -->
```ts
    ).toEqual([
      // The shared home. Every scan in the suite recurses through here.
      'tests/source-files.ts',
      // The detector itself: the one other file that must name the syntax,
      // in order to find it anywhere else.
      'tests/unit/one-home.test.ts',
    ]);
```
```ts
    ).toEqual([
      // The commit job's walk of a downloaded artifact (#459). filesUnder
      // skips dotfiles and node_modules and refuses an empty walk, which
      // would blind a validator to exactly what it exists to refuse; this
      // one reads every entry with lstat and follows no symlink.
      'scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs',
      // The shared home. Every scan in the suite recurses through here.
      'tests/source-files.ts',
      // The detector itself: the one other file that must name the syntax,
      // in order to find it anywhere else.
      'tests/unit/one-home.test.ts',
    ]);
```

<!-- edit: tests/unit/one-home.test.ts -->
```ts
    ).toEqual([
      // The recursion. An empty sub-result is ordinary here and must stay
      // that way, so the proof belongs to the exported top-level form.
      'tests/source-files.ts',
```
```ts
    ).toEqual([
      // The artifact walk (#459): an empty artifact is input for
      // validateArtifact to refuse by name, never an exception here.
      'scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs',
      // The recursion. An empty sub-result is ordinary here and must stay
      // that way, so the proof belongs to the exported top-level form.
      'tests/source-files.ts',
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run both files, the typechecker and the whole suite**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts tests/unit/visual-rebaseline-cli.test.ts`
Expected: 90 passed (83 + 7, measured, plan review pass 4).

Run: `npx astro check`
Expected: `0 errors`, `0 warnings`, `0 hints`. Filter the summary with `(error|warning|hint)s?` and expect three lines.

Run: `npx vitest run`
Expected: the whole unit suite green. A new file is invisible to the tracked-file guards until it is added, so run `git add -N` on the new files first.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit, then mutate**

```bash
git add scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs tests/unit/visual-rebaseline-cli.test.ts
git commit -m "visual-rebaseline: the capture and commit commands (Refs #459)"
```

| # | Mutation | Predicted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | `runClassify`: drop `gateAgrees` | RED: the exit disagreement |
| C2 | `runStage`: do not copy the files | RED: stage, missing file |
| C3 | `main`: `exit(0)` in the catch | RED: unknown command, disagreement, unchanged |
| C4 | `entriesUnder` skips names starting with `.` | RED: sees a dotfile |

---

### Task 5: `ci.yml` can be dispatched

**Files:**
- Modify: `.github/workflows/ci.yml:26-31`
- Modify: `tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts` (the two trigger pins)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `ci.yml` with `on:` holding exactly `pull_request`, `workflow_call` and `workflow_dispatch`. Task 7's `commit` dispatches it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Change both pins**

<!-- edit: tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts -->
```ts
    // The whole trigger set, exactly: callable, and still nothing else.
    expect(Object.keys(ci.on ?? {}).sort()).toEqual([
      'pull_request',
      'workflow_call',
    ]);
```
```ts
    // The whole trigger set, exactly: callable, dispatchable for the visual
    // rebaseline's commit (#459), and still nothing else.
    expect(Object.keys(ci.on ?? {}).sort()).toEqual([
      'pull_request',
      'workflow_call',
      'workflow_dispatch',
    ]);
```

<!-- edit: tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts -->
```ts
    // request is allowed only because the key falls back to the run's own id,
    // a group of one that cancels nothing. The one such trigger is
    // `workflow_call`, the dispatch path running this suite (#163).
    expect(
      Object.keys(ci.on ?? {}).sort(),
      'a trigger besides pull_request needs a key no other run shares',
    ).toEqual(['pull_request', 'workflow_call']);
```
```ts
    // request is allowed only because the key falls back to the run's own id,
    // a group of one that cancels nothing. There are two such triggers:
    // `workflow_call`, the dispatch path running this suite (#163), and
    // `workflow_dispatch`, which the visual rebaseline's commit uses to run CI
    // on the head it wrote (#459).
    expect(
      Object.keys(ci.on ?? {}).sort(),
      'a trigger besides pull_request needs a key no other run shares',
    ).toEqual(['pull_request', 'workflow_call', 'workflow_dispatch']);
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Watch both fail**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts`
Expected: 2 failed, each showing `workflow_dispatch` missing from the received triggers.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the trigger**

<!-- edit: .github/workflows/ci.yml -->
```yaml
# `workflow_call` is the one other trigger, and it is not a push: it is how
# deploy-dev.yml's dispatch path runs THIS suite on a branch that has no pull
# request, rather than a copy of it that could drift (#163).
on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_call:
```
```yaml
# `workflow_call` is not a push either: it is how deploy-dev.yml's dispatch
# path runs THIS suite on a branch that has no pull request, rather than a
# copy of it that could drift (#163).
#
# `workflow_dispatch` is how the visual rebaseline's commit runs CI on the
# head it wrote (#459). A push made with a job's own GITHUB_TOKEN starts no
# workflow, and a dispatch is one of the two events GitHub exempts. The
# dispatched run has no pull request number, so its concurrency key falls
# back to its run id, and the checks it posts land on the branch head by
# name, which is what branch protection and scripts/deploy-gate.mjs read.
on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_call:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Watch them pass, then run the whole suite**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts`
Expected: all pass.

Run: `npx vitest run`
Expected: green.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts
git commit -m "ci.yml can be dispatched, for the rebaseline's commit (Refs #459)"
```

---

### Task 6: The capture workflow

**Files:**
- Create: `.github/workflows/visual-rebaseline.yml`
- Modify: `tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts` (narrow the `--update-snapshots` guard, and append the capture guards)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `qualify`, `classify` and `stage` (Task 4), `scripts/playwright-image.mjs`, and `ARTIFACT` (`visual-rebaseline`).
- Produces: a workflow named exactly `Visual rebaseline capture`, which uploads the artifact `visual-rebaseline` when there is something to commit.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing guards**

<!-- edit: tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts -->
```ts
  it('never passes --update-snapshots, in any workflow', () => {
    // `workflowFileNames` refuses an empty read (#84), so this loop cannot
    // run over nothing and report success.
    for (const name of workflowFileNames()) {
      if (!name.endsWith('.yml') && !name.endsWith('.yaml')) continue;
      expect(
        withoutCommentLines(workflow(name), '#'),
        `${name} can rewrite the baseline it is checking against`,
      ).not.toContain('--update-snapshots');
    }
  });
```
```ts
  it('passes --update-snapshots in no workflow but the rebaseline capture (#459)', () => {
    // The capture recaptures in a throwaway checkout, and what it writes
    // reaches the repository only as a commit the operator reviews. Every
    // other workflow, the gate included, must never rewrite a baseline.
    const read = workflowYamlNames();
    // Measured 2026-10-03: 12 workflow files once #459 lands (the two lock
    // workflows added, the #460 probe's two deleted). 11 also holds through
    // Task 6 alone, where the capture is the eleventh.
    expect(read.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(11);
    const rewriting = read.filter((name) =>
      withoutCommentLines(workflow(name), '#').includes('--update-snapshots'),
    );
    expect(searched(rewriting, { of: read, what: 'workflow files' })).toEqual([
      'visual-rebaseline.yml',
    ]);
  });
```

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts`
Expected: 11 failed, 100 passed (measured, plan review pass 10). The narrowed guard fails on its floor (`expected 10 to be greater than or equal to 11`: ten workflows, the #460 probe's two included and the capture not yet among them), and the ten capture guards fail with `ENOENT` on `visual-rebaseline.yml`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the workflow**

<!-- create: .github/workflows/visual-rebaseline.yml -->
```yaml
name: Visual rebaseline capture
# The UNPRIVILEGED half of the visual rebaseline (#459). Design:
# docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-visual-rebaseline-design.md.
#
# A Playwright release ships new browsers, and new browsers can move pixels
# while the site is unchanged. For a pull request Dependabot opened that
# updates Playwright and nothing else, this reruns the visual gate in the
# gate's own image, recaptures exactly the screenshots it failed on pixels
# alone, and uploads them. The commit workflow, which runs only the
# default branch's code, decides whether they reach the branch.
#
# It runs pull-request code (a new Playwright is third-party code), so it
# holds a read-only token and no secret, and no checkout keeps a token. It is
# not a required check: on any other pull request every job is skipped, and a
# pull request that does not qualify ends green with its reason in the
# summary. A red `visual` on such a pull request stays red for a person to
# diagnose (operator, 2026-10-03: "we cannot afford to allow any visual bugs
# go unnoticed and unfixed").

- [ ] **Step 4: Watch the guards pass, then run the whole suite**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts`
Expected: all pass.

Run: `npx vitest run`
Expected: green. Every repo-wide workflow guard now reads a new file: SHA pins, timeouts, permissions, the image selector and the browser jobs. If any of them refuses it, fix the workflow, never the guard.

Run: `npx prettier --check .`
Expected: clean.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit, then mutate**

```bash
git add .github/workflows/visual-rebaseline.yml tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts
git commit -m "The visual rebaseline capture workflow (Refs #459)"
```

Each mutation edits `visual-rebaseline.yml` (or `ci.yml` for W1) alone and runs the whole of `pipeline-wiring.test.ts`:

| # | Mutation | Predicted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| W1 | `ci.yml`'s visual job gains `--update-snapshots` | RED: the narrowed guard |
| W2 | workflow `contents: write` | RED: writes nothing |
| W3 | `capture` job gains `permissions: { contents: read }` | RED: no job permissions |
| W4 | `qualify` gets `env: { T: ${{ secrets.X }} }` | RED: reads no secret |
| W5 | `qualify` gets `env: { T: ${{ secrets['X'] }} }` | RED: reads no secret (the bracket form) |
| W6 | the capture checkout drops `persist-credentials: false` | RED: no token |
| W7 | the capture checkout drops its `ref` | RED: head, not merge ref |
| W8 | the recapture moves above the gate step | RED: after the gate ran |
| W9 | the list step drops `VISUAL: '1'` | RED: declares the visual project |
| W10 | `qualify`'s `if:` removed | RED: acts only for Dependabot |
| W11 | `name:` changed to `Visual rebaseline` | RED: named as the commit names it |
| W12 | `capture` loses its `if:` | RED: the repo-wide skipped-upstream guard (#157), and the capture's condition pin |

### Task 7: The commit workflow

**Files:**
- Create: `.github/workflows/visual-rebaseline-commit.yml`
- Modify: `tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts` (append the commit guards and the no-retry guard)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `find` and `commit` (Task 4), and the capture's `name:` (Task 6).
- Produces: the end-to-end chain that Task 12 proves, once Task 10 has added its `locked` step.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing guards**

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Watch them fail**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts`
Expected: 8 failed, 112 passed (measured, plan review passes 6 and 10): the seven commit guards and `visual-rebaseline-commit.yml retries nothing`, each with `ENOENT` on `visual-rebaseline-commit.yml`. `visual-rebaseline.yml retries nothing` passes.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the workflow**

<!-- create: .github/workflows/visual-rebaseline-commit.yml -->
```yaml
name: Visual rebaseline commit
# The PRIVILEGED half of the visual rebaseline (#459). Design:
# docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-visual-rebaseline-design.md.
#
# `workflow_run` always runs the DEFAULT branch's copy of this file, so a pull
# request cannot change what it does, and GitHub's read-only rule for runs
# Dependabot triggers covers push and pull_request events, not this one, so
# the job gets exactly the scopes it declares. It checks out only the
# default branch, installs only that lockfile with --ignore-scripts (the
# dispatch check parses YAML with the repository's `yaml` package), and runs
# only scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs from that checkout. Nothing from the pull
# request is checked out, installed or run. The artifact is data: walked with
# lstat, validated down to each PNG's bytes, and refused whole on any doubt.
#
# Then it commits the PNGs through the Git Data API (fast-forward only),
# dispatches ci.yml on the branch, since a push made with this token starts
# no workflow, and labels the pull request for the operator's review. No
# agent merges it before the operator has approved the PNG diff (CLAUDE.md).
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ['Visual rebaseline capture']
    types: [completed]

permissions:
  contents: read

concurrency:

    runs-on: ubuntu-26.04
    timeout-minutes: 10
    permissions:
      contents: write
      actions: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
      # No npm cache in a job that can write: a cache is shared state.
      - uses: actions/setup-node@820762786026740c76f36085b0efc47a31fe5020 # v7.0.0
        with:
          node-version-file: .nvmrc
      - run: npm ci --ignore-scripts
      - name: Find the capture's upload
        id: find
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
          RUN_ID: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
        run: node scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs find
      - name: Download it into an empty directory
        if: steps.find.outputs.present == 'true'
        uses: actions/download-artifact@3e5f45b2cfb9172054b4087a40e8e0b5a5461e7c # v8.0.1

          RUN_HEAD_SHA: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}
        run: node scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs commit
```

Now that the file exists, the capture's header can name it. Naming it in Task 6 would have turned *no workflow names a workflow file that does not exist* red for that task's commit (measured, plan review pass 5):

<!-- edit: .github/workflows/visual-rebaseline.yml -->
```yaml
# alone, and uploads them. The commit workflow, which runs only the
# default branch's code, decides whether they reach the branch.
```
```yaml
# alone, and uploads them. visual-rebaseline-commit.yml, which runs only the
# default branch's code, decides whether they reach the branch.
```

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts`
Expected: all pass.

Run: `npx vitest run && npx astro check && npx prettier --check .`
Expected: green, `0 errors / 0 warnings / 0 hints`, clean.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit, then mutate**

```bash
git add .github/workflows/visual-rebaseline-commit.yml tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts
git commit -m "The visual rebaseline commit workflow (Refs #459)"
```

| # | Mutation | Predicted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| K1 | add `pull_request:` to `on` | RED: nothing else starts it |
| K2 | `workflows: ['Visual rebaseline']` | RED: names the capture |

| K4 | `npm ci` without `--ignore-scripts` | RED: installs only |
| K5 | a step `run: npx playwright --version` | RED: installs only |
| K6 | the commit step runs `node ${{ runner.temp }}/rebaseline/x.mjs` | RED: own checkout's scripts |
| K7 | the job `if:` drops the event check | RED: successful capture of a PR |
| K8 | workflow-level `contents: write` | RED: one job writes |
| K9 | the download drops `run-id` | RED: the triggering run's artifact |
| K10 | the capture gate gains `--retries=1` | RED: `visual-rebaseline.yml retries nothing` |
| K11 | the commit step becomes `until node scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs commit; do :; done` | RED: the no-retry guard, and the node guard |
| K12 | the commit step becomes `while ! node scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs commit; do :; done` | RED: the no-retry guard, and the node guard |
| K13 | a step `uses: nick-fields/retry@` followed by forty zeros (a placeholder SHA: the guard reads the action's name) | RED: the no-retry guard's action check |
| K14 | the checkout gains `repository: someone/fork` | RED: default branch only |
| K15 | the checkout's `persist-credentials: false` becomes `true` | RED: default branch only, keeping no token |
| K16 | `npm ci --ignore-scripts` becomes `npm install --ignore-scripts` | RED: installs only |
| K25 | `runLinesOf` reads no line at all | RED: both no-retry guards on their floors (8 and, once Task 10 lands, 3), the node guard's floor, and every other guard that reads run lines (installs only, the capture's `--update-snapshots` placement, Task 9's allow-list) |

### Task 8: The verdict that holds a rebaseline's merge

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/operator-review.mjs`
- Create: `tests/unit/operator-review.test.ts`
- Modify: `tests/unit/script-entry.test.ts` (register the script)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `messageOf` (`scripts/errors.mjs`).
- Produces: `reviewVerdict({ total, commits, reviews, head }): { state: 'success' | 'failure', description: string }`, which throws on a refusal. `commits` is `{ sha: string, author: string | null, paths: string[], truncated: boolean }[]`; `reviews` is `{ user: string | null, state: string, commitId: string }[]`, oldest first, as the list endpoint returns them; `total` is the pull request's own `commits` count and `head` the SHA the verdict is for. Also `OPERATOR`. Two commands for Task 9, each reading `PR_NUMBER`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`: `head` writes the step output `sha`, and `verdict` reads `HEAD_SHA` and writes `state` and `description`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

- [ ] **Step 3b: Register the script with the entry guard**

<!-- edit: tests/unit/script-entry.test.ts -->
```ts
  // The three that did all their work at module scope until #276. Each refuses
```
```ts
  // With no command it can decide nothing, so it refuses by name before it
  // reads a variable or calls GitHub, and the status stays pending (#459).
  'operator-review.mjs': {
    args: [],
    status: 1,
    says: 'unknown command (none); expected head or verdict',
  },
  // The three that did all their work at module scope until #276. Each refuses
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the file, the typechecker and the whole suite**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/operator-review.test.ts`
Expected: 15 passed.

Run: `npx astro check`
Expected: `0 errors`, `0 warnings`, `0 hints` (three lines through `(error|warning|hint)s?`).

Run: `git add -N scripts/operator-review.mjs tests/unit/operator-review.test.ts && npx vitest run`
Expected: the whole unit suite green.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit, then mutate**

```bash
git add scripts/operator-review.mjs tests/unit/operator-review.test.ts tests/unit/script-entry.test.ts
git commit -m "operator-review: the verdict that holds an automatic rebaseline (Refs #459)"
```

| # | Mutation | Predicted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| O1 | drop `\|\| author === null` | RED: no account |
| O2 | `SCREENSHOTS` loses its trailing slash | RED: only begins like the folder |
| O3 | `DECISIVE` gains `'COMMENTED'` | RED: a comment follows it |
| O4 | drop `&& decision.commitId === head` | RED: an older commit |
| O5 | drop `user === OPERATOR &&` | RED: the App's, Dependabot's |
| O6 | `.at(-1)` becomes `.at(0)` | RED: changes requested after, approval given again |
| O7 | drop the count refusal | RED: a shorter list |
| O8 | drop the truncation refusal | RED: a truncated file list |
| O9 | `main`: `exit(0)` in the catch | RED: the script-entry probe's three runs of `operator-review.mjs` |

The network half (`read`, `everyPage`, the two commands) talks only to GitHub, so Task 12 proves it on the real runner, as Task 4 does for its own commands.

---

### Task 9: The lock's two workflows

**Files:**
- Create: `.github/workflows/operator-review.yml`
- Create: `.github/workflows/operator-review-relay.yml`
- Modify: `tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts` (append the lock guards)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the `head` and `verdict` commands (Task 8).
- Produces: the commit status `operator-review` on every pull request's head, which Task 11 asks the operator to require.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing guards**

# It checks out only the default branch, keeping no token, installs nothing
# (the script uses Node's own fetch), and runs scripts/operator-review.mjs
# and `gh api`, which posts each status: `pending` on the event's head before
# any read, `pending` on the current head when a push has moved it, then the

### Task 10: Nothing commits a rebaseline until the lock is required

**Files:**
- Modify: `scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs` (`lockRequired`, `LOCK`, the `locked` command)
- Modify: `tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts`, `tests/unit/visual-rebaseline-cli.test.ts`, `tests/unit/script-entry.test.ts` (the command list)
- Modify: `.github/workflows/visual-rebaseline-commit.yml` (the `locked` step)
- Modify: `tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts` (the step's guard, and two measured counts)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `getJson` and `report` (Task 4); the lock's name (Task 9).
- Produces: `lockRequired(branch: unknown): boolean` and `LOCK`; the command `locked`, which refuses by name unless `develop` requires the lock.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

<!-- edit: tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts -->

  it('asks before the download and before the commit', () => {

    expect(String(locked?.if)).not.toMatch(/\b(?:always|failure|cancelled)\(/);
    expect(locked?.['continue-on-error']).toBeUndefined();
  });
});
```

The step now counts toward two measured figures in Task 7's guards:

<!-- edit: tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts -->
```ts
    // Measured: 2 (find, commit).
    expect(nodes.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1);
```
```ts
    // Measured: 3 (find, locked, commit).
    expect(nodes.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(2);
```

<!-- edit: tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts -->
```ts
  [COMMIT]: 3,
```
```ts
  [COMMIT]: 4,
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Watch them fail**

Add `lockRequired` to `scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs` as a throwing stub, then run:

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/visual-rebaseline.test.ts tests/unit/visual-rebaseline-cli.test.ts tests/unit/script-entry.test.ts tests/unit/pipeline-wiring.test.ts`
Expected: 12 failed, 337 passed (measured, plan review pass 10): the 6 `lockRequired` tests, the CLI's unknown command, both new wiring guards, and the script-entry probe's three runs of `visual-rebaseline.mjs` (from this checkout, through a path holding a space, through a symlink). The two moved floors still pass, since each is the new figure less one, which the old count meets; K24 below is what shows the step's absence going red.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the check, the command and the step**

<!-- edit: scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs -->
```js

### Task 11: Document, label, merge, deploy, and hand the lock to the operator

**Files:**
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md`
- Delete: `.github/workflows/probe-459.yml`, `.github/workflows/probe-459-relay.yml`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the paragraph**

<!-- edit: CLAUDE.md -->
```markdown
- **The visual suite is opt-in, and both sides run the same pinned image.**
```
```markdown
- **A Dependabot Playwright update rebaselines itself, and a required check holds it for the operator (#459).** New browsers can move pixels while the site is unchanged. For a pull request Dependabot opened, from this repository, level with `develop`, whose diff is Playwright and nothing else (`scripts/visual-rebaseline.mjs`'s `qualify`), `visual-rebaseline.yml` reruns the gate in the gate's image and recaptures exactly the screenshots it failed on pixels alone. `visual-rebaseline-commit.yml` runs only `develop`'s code: it refuses until `develop` requires the lock, validates the upload down to each PNG's bytes, commits it as `github-actions[bot]` (fast-forward only), dispatches `ci.yml` there and labels the pull request `rebaseline-needs-review`. **The lock is the commit status `operator-review`**, which `operator-review.yml` posts on every pull request from `develop`'s copy (`scripts/operator-review.mjs` decides): `success` when no commit by `github-actions[bot]` touches a screenshot, and otherwise only once `ShydenMcM` has approved at the current head, so any later push holds it again. `operator-review-relay.yml` holds no permission and exists only because a review fires no `pull_request_target`. Making it a required check on `develop`, with no app pinned, is administration and so the operator's; until he has, nothing commits a rebaseline. An agent never posts that status, never approves in his place, and never merges past it. Any other update, Astro and fonts included, keeps a red `visual` for a person to diagnose (operator, 2026-10-03: _"we cannot afford to allow any visual bugs go unnoticed and unfixed"_).
- **The visual suite is opt-in, and both sides run the same pinned image.**
```

- [ ] **Step 1b: Hold the rule in memory too**

Write `~/.claude/projects/-Users-shyden-Developer-Repos-shyden-co-uk/memory/a-rebaseline-waits-for-the-operator.md` with frontmatter `name: a-rebaseline-waits-for-the-operator`, `type: feedback`, and this body: a pull request carrying an automatic rebaseline is held by the required check `operator-review` until the operator approves its PNG diff at the head; an agent never posts that status, never approves for him, never pushes to such a branch to move it along, and never merges past a red or missing check. **Why:** operator decision 4, 2026-10-03 (#459 comment 5967363108), after a side review found only a label and a sentence standing between a bot-written baseline and `develop`, while agents merge green pull requests there without asking; and his words, *"we cannot afford to allow any visual bugs go unnoticed and unfixed"*. **How to apply:** when `operator-review` is red or missing on a pull request, notify the operator with its link and move on to other work. Then add its one-line pointer to `MEMORY.md`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Retire the probe**

The probe merged in #460 measured the tokens this design rests on. Its rows are on #459 (comment 5967707811), and its last row, a Dependabot-triggered `pull_request_target`, is read before this merges (Step 6).

```bash
git rm .github/workflows/probe-459.yml .github/workflows/probe-459-relay.yml
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the whole gate and push**

Run: `npx prettier --check . && npx astro check && npx vitest run`
Expected: clean, `0 / 0 / 0`, green.

```bash
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "CLAUDE.md: the visual rebaseline and the lock that holds it; retire the probe (Refs #459)"
git push -u origin 459-visual-rebaseline
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Create the label**

```bash
gh label create rebaseline-needs-review --color B60205 \
  --description "Visual baselines rebaselined automatically (#459); operator-review holds the merge for the operator"
gh label list --search rebaseline-needs-review
```

Expected: the list prints the label, read back after the write.

- [ ] **Step 5: Open the pull request and wait**

Write the body to `.superpowers/sdd/459/pr.md` with `Refs #459` and the attribution footer. Check it with `node scripts/closing-keywords.mjs .superpowers/sdd/459/pr.md "this pull request body"`, then run `gh pr create --base develop --body-file …`. Wait with `~/.claude/scripts/wait-run.sh` in a `run_in_background` call, then read every step by name with the run's SHA matched to `headRefOid`, which is read into a file.

- [ ] **Step 6: Merge only once Dependabot's own row is measured**

Read #459 for the probe's row from a pull request Dependabot opened (`.superpowers/sdd/459/probe-read.sh`, with `measure.sha` at that pull request's head). If it is not recorded yet, the pull request stays open until Dependabot's next run (Monday, 06:00 UTC) records it. If its `pull_request_target` run could not post a status (anything but HTTP 201), stop: a Dependabot pull request would never get its `success`, and the design goes back to the operator.

- [ ] **Step 7: Merge and deploy**

Merge with a merge commit. Wait for `deploy-dev.yml` on the merge, read each job by name, and read `dev-verified` off the commit.

- [ ] **Step 8: Hand the lock to the operator**

Requiring the check is administration, which the agent App holds read-only. Send a `PushNotification`, then ask with `AskUserQuestion`, the request stated in the question text itself: add `operator-review` to `develop`'s required status checks with no app pinned (any source), as `dev-verified` is, since the agent App's statuses access is read-only and it cannot post one at all (spec, Unit 4); until then the commit workflow refuses every rebaseline by name, which is the intended state. Once he says it is done, read `GET /branches/develop` and confirm the protection's checks list the lock, rather than trusting the answer. Task 12 starts only after that read.

---

### Task 12: Find a release that drifts, then prove the chain end to end

This task runs on the real runner after the merge. GitHub fires `workflow_run` only for a workflow on the default branch, and the dispatch needs `ci.yml`'s new trigger there too. It needs an open Dependabot pull request. Dependabot runs weekly, on Monday at 06:00 UTC, so the earliest is 2026-10-05. Every run ID is recorded on #459.

- [ ] **Step 1: Pick the pull request**

First confirm the lock is required: Task 11 Step 8's read of `GET /branches/develop` lists it. Until it does, the commit workflow refuses by name and nothing here can be proved.

`gh pr list --author app/dependabot --state open`. Pick one whose head is level with `develop`. If none is open, stop: write the handover, notify the operator, and resume after the next Dependabot run.

- [ ] **Step 2: Search for a drifting release, using the shipped capture**

On that branch, pushed as the App (so the PR author stays `dependabot[bot]`), make one commit that returns the PR's own change to `develop` and sets Playwright to a candidate:

```bash
git switch <dependabot-branch>
git checkout origin/develop -- package.json package-lock.json docker/playwright/Dockerfile
npm install --save-dev --no-audit --no-fund "@playwright/test@^<candidate>"
git diff --stat origin/develop
git commit -am "Proof (#459): Playwright <candidate>, measuring drift"
git push
```

`git diff --stat` must name only `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. The push runs `ci.yml` (as a pull request) and `Visual rebaseline capture`. The capture's `qualify` must report `Qualifies`. `playwright-image.mjs` resolves the candidate's noble digest, and `classify` reports whether the gate failed on pixels alone. Candidates are newest first: 1.58.2, 1.57.0, 1.56.1, 1.55.1, 1.54.2, 1.53.2, 1.52.0, 1.51.1, 1.50.1, 1.49.1, 1.48.2, 1.47.2, 1.46.1, 1.45.3, each the latest patch of its minor, with its noble digest resolved on 2026-10-03. Every run is recorded on #459 with its `classify` line. A candidate that fails on anything other than pixels (an older Playwright that cannot load today's config) is recorded as that and skipped.

If no candidate drifts, stop. Notify the operator and ask how to proceed before building any proof.

- [ ] **Step 3: The positive proof**

The first drifting candidate is the proof. On its capture run the commit workflow must, in order:

1. push a commit to the Dependabot branch;
2. dispatch `ci.yml` there;
3. have the dispatched run's checks accepted by branch protection: on the new head every required check but the lock reads `success`, and `gh pr view <n> --json mergeStateStatus` reads `BLOCKED`, because the new head carries no `operator-review` (a push made with `GITHUB_TOKEN` starts no `pull_request_target`).

Also confirm that the PR shows the PNG diff, the label and the comment. If any of the three fails, stop and take it to the operator.

- [ ] **Step 3b: The lock**

On the same pull request, in order, recording each status read off the head:

1. An App approval (`gh pr review <n> --approve`) runs the relay, then `operator-review.yml`, which posts `failure`, "Waiting for the operator to approve the rebaseline at <sha7>": an agent's approval releases nothing.
2. Ask the operator (a `PushNotification`, then `AskUserQuestion` naming the pull request and its head, read from the API in the same turn) to review the PNG diff and approve it if it is right. His approval turns the status `success`, and `mergeStateStatus` reads `CLEAN`. The approval proves the lock, not a merge: the pull request carries a downgrade and is never merged.
3. The negative proof's next push (Step 4) moves the head, and `operator-review` reads `pending` there, then `failure`.

Separately, the next pull request an agent opens gets `success`, "No automatic rebaseline in this pull request".

- [ ] **Step 4: The negative proofs**

On the same pull request, one commit that also changes a source file gets `No rebaseline: it changes more than dependencies`. One that groups Playwright with `@fontsource-variable/instrument-sans` 5.2.4 gets `package-lock.json changes node_modules/@fontsource-variable/instrument-sans`, and its `visual` stays red.

- [ ] **Step 5: Dependabot as the actor**

Comment `@dependabot recreate`. Dependabot rebuilds the pull request from scratch and discards the proof's commits. The capture then runs under Dependabot's own restricted token and ends green, qualifying or not as the rule decides for the rebuilt diff, and `operator-review.yml`, started by Dependabot's `pull_request_target`, posts `success` on the rebuilt head, which carries no rebaseline. Record both runs, then retire #459 with `gh issue close 459` once every AC is evidenced on it.

## Review log

| Pass | Findings |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Assembled and run (`.superpowers/sdd/459/pass.sh`): prettier wanted 75 hunks (every block now formatted in place by `format_blocks.py`); 8 meta-guards refused the code: an absence with no population, a duplicated walker, two private directory walkers and a private caught-message reader (one-home), `image`/`capture` relying on implicit `success()` (#157), the `import.meta.main` inventory, consecutive docblocks |
| 2 | Run clean (3508/3508, 0/0/0). Reading: V3 could never go red (the symlink fixture had no bytes, so another clause refused it); R4 predicted the wrong test; R2's prediction was left open, and reasoning it through showed no test could kill it (two comparisons in one test added) |
| 3 | 46 mutations run, all RED for the predicted test, totals steady. Reading the spec against the plan: the hash-for-`git diff` deviation was unstated; the comment paraphrased the spec's line; the memory half of the review rule was missing; five forms were never planted (K12-K16); K13's first draft carried an invented SHA |
| 4 | Run clean, K12-K16 RED as predicted. Counts measured by assembling through each task: 23, 47, 83, 90, where the plan said 48, 86, 93, and the CLI red run said 6 for 7 |
| 5 | Reading the prose whole: Task 1's mutation step came before its commit; Task 4's interfaces omitted `entriesUnder`; C4 and W12 ran but had no rows. Running each task's intermediate state (not only the finished assembly): through Tasks 4 and 5 green, through Task 6 one red. The capture's comment named `visual-rebaseline-commit.yml` a task before it exists, which *no workflow names a workflow file that does not exist* refuses, so Task 7 now adds the name |
| 6 | Run clean, and the whole suite green at every intermediate state (through Tasks 4, 5, 6 and 7: 3489, 3489, 3499, 3508). Reading the whole prose, then measuring each red-run claim by rebuilding its state: Task 6's narrowed guard fails on its floor (8 of 9 workflows), not on `[]` as written; Task 7's claim held exactly |
| 7 | None. Run clean (3508/3508, 0/0/0, prettier clean); the assembled code is byte-identical to pass 6's (`git diff` empty), so its mutations and intermediate states stand; the whole prose read. **Approved 2026-10-03** (operator rule 2026-09-24: reviewed to zero, then self-approved). |
| 8 | After decision 4 (spec passes 19-24): Tasks 8-10 added (the verdict, the lock's workflows, the `locked` step), Task 11 rewritten (the lock in `CLAUDE.md` and memory, the probe retired, the merge waiting on Dependabot's own row, requiring the check handed to the operator), Task 12 given the lock's proof and `BLOCKED` before approval. The branch merged `develop` (b839ff8, which brought the probe's two files) and `pass.sh` now assembles onto it, copies this plan into the scratch tree (the suite's guards read prose) and deletes the probe as Task 11 does. Run clean (3543/3543, 0/0/0, prettier clean), counts as expected (15, 89, 122, 131). 34 new mutations, all RED for the predicted test with steady totals. Findings: the allow-list test's raw-count cross-check sat after the exact list, so no blind reader could ever reach it (L6's prediction was unreachable); L1, L16 and K24 predicted fewer tests than went red; Task 3's comment and commit message still carried the process rule; Task 6's workflow floor and Task 7's shared no-retry floor were no longer tight. `producibleContexts` cannot see a status posted from a script, so the workflow posts it (a stated departure). |
| 9 | Run clean (3543/3543, 0/0/0). The cross-check now runs first: L18 (a reader blind to block-form runs) went RED on it, `expected 5 to be 6`, and L6 on the measured count, `7` for `6`; all 23 wiring mutations RED as predicted. |
| 10 | Every intermediate state rebuilt and run whole (`states.py`): green through Tasks 7, 8, 9 and 10 (3508, 3526, 3535, 3543). Each red-run claim rebuilt from its own state: Tasks 7, 8 and 9 held (8/112, 15, 9/120), but Task 6's floor message now reads `10` for `11` (the probe's two files) and Task 10 fails 12, not 10 (the script-entry probe runs each script three ways). Reading the new tasks' prose whole: Task 11 gave the wrong reason for no app pinned (the spec's is that the agent App cannot post a status); O9's row named one probe run of three |
| 11 | Run clean (3543/3543, 0/0/0); assembled code byte-identical to pass 9's. Reading the whole plan: Task 7's per-file no-retry floors had never been seen red on the commit side (L18 blinds only block-form runs, which the commit workflow has none of), so K25 blinds the reader entirely. Every mutation in the plan, the 52 from passes 1-7 and the 35 since, run against the final assembly: 87 of 87 RED for the predicted tests, totals steady per file (89, 7, 131, 15, 122), every file restored; K25 failed seven guards, both floors among them |
| 12 | None. Run clean (3543/3543, 0/0/0, prettier clean); the assembled code is byte-identical to pass 11's, so its 87 mutations and pass 10's intermediate states stand; the prose changed since pass 11's whole read (K25's row, this log) read; no context claim beside the protection field anywhere in the plan (the same search finds `CLAUDE.md`'s one). **Approved again 2026-10-03**, with the lock (operator rule 2026-09-24: reviewed to zero, then self-approved). |
