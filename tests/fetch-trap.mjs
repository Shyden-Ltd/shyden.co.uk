 *
 * `FETCH_TRAP_RECORD` names a file. The trap writes `loaded` to it the moment
 * it loads, then a `request <url>` line for every request it refuses. The log
 * is the population a "made no request" assertion searched: a missing or
 * empty log means the trap never ran, and "no request" read from it would
 * mean nothing (#79's sentinel, for the same reason). Only the URL is written
 * -- a DeepL request carries its key in a header.
