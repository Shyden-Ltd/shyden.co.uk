/**
 * The dual-mode interaction layer -- design doc
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-08-real-device-test-harness-design.md,
 * section 5a.
 *
 * Measured on this device (iPhone Air, iOS 27.0, build 24A5390f):
 * `element/click`, `element/value` and W3C `actions` all return SUCCESS
 * while having NO effect -- no on-screen change, no keyboard, no form
 * submission, confirmed across multiple elements and an unrelated site.
 * Ruled out by direct measurement (not assumed): the device is unlocked
 * (no passcode), awake (launching Safari via `devicectl` changes nothing),
 * and the page is visible/focused throughout. A WebDriver screenshot is
 * NOT evidence of an awake device -- it captures the page viewport, which
 * renders regardless.
 *
 * The fallback, verified working: driving interaction through
 * `execute/sync` by DOM dispatch -- calling `el.click()` in-page, and
 * setting `.value` then firing `input`/`change`. This still runs the
 * page's real handlers inside real WebKit, so it still catches real
 * rendering/logic defects on real Safari -- it does NOT exercise the
 * touch input path itself: taps actually reaching targets, focus-zoom,
 * momentum scroll are unverified in this mode. See `InteractionMode`.
 *
 * Nothing here is assumed for a given run: `detectInteractionMode` is a
 * canary that measures which mode this session actually needs, every
 * time, so if a future OS build restores real input injection the suite
 * notices and upgrades itself -- and says so (see session.ts, which logs
 * the outcome prominently).
