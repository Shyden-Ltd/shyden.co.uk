/**
 * iOS WebDriver session lifecycle: starts `safaridriver` on a free port,
 * finds the real device, creates the one WebDriver session the device
 * allows, asks the device itself which of the Mac's addresses it can
 * actually reach, asserts every precondition with a named cause, and tears
 * everything down again.
 *
 * See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-08-real-device-test-harness-design.md,
 * section 5, for why this exists instead of Playwright.
 *
 * "if (ok) { act() }" with no `else` is a known defect class on this
 * project -- every precondition below asserts its end state and throws a
 * specific, named cause rather than falling through silently.
 *
 * Also writes two small artifacts under test-results/ that
 * scripts/test-devices.mjs (the parallel runner, `npm run test:devices`)
 * reads, because neither fact is otherwise visible from outside this
 * process: which interaction mode the design doc s5a canary decided on this
 * run (`ios-mode.json`), and, while a session is genuinely open, enough to
 * delete it from another process if this one dies before `teardown()` runs
 * (`ios-session-marker.json`) -- see the "Artifacts for the runner" section
 * below. Both are inert when nothing reads them, so a plain `npm run
 * test:ios` is unaffected.

 *
 * Measured, not assumed: `xcrun devicectl list devices --json-output -`
 * prints its plain-text table to STDERR and pure JSON to STDOUT when the
 * path argument is `-` (confirmed by redirecting each stream separately),
 * so `execFileSync`'s returned stdout is clean JSON with nothing to strip.
 *
 * Also measured, and the reason this reads a nested field rather than the
 * obvious top-level one: devicectl's top-level `identifier` field is a
 * CoreDevice UUID (e.g. `74563FF8-D1FC-...`), NOT the classic ECID-style
 * UDID `safari:deviceUDID` expects (e.g. `00008150-000954D90A20401C`).
 * Using `identifier` would silently hand safaridriver the wrong value. The
 * real classic UDID lives at `hardwareProperties.udid` (confirmed by
 * walking the full JSON tree for a known UDID string on a live device --
 * it also appears, duplicated, at `properties.hardware.udid`, but
 * `hardwareProperties.udid` is the more directly-typed path here).
 *
 * scripts/test-devices.mjs (the parallel runner) asks this same real
 * question as its own upfront presence check, but through its OWN,
 * self-contained copy of this parsing rather than importing this function:
 * measured directly (not assumed) that plain Node cannot load this module
 * graph even with this repo's pinned Node (.nvmrc: 24), which strips
 * TypeScript *types* natively but not TypeScript *syntax that requires a
 * real transform* -- `webdriver.ts` and `interaction.ts` both use
 * constructor parameter properties (e.g. `constructor(private readonly
 * driver: WebDriver)`), which Node's strip-only mode explicitly rejects
 * with `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_TYPESCRIPT_SYNTAX`. Rewriting those constructors to
 * dodge that, purely so a plain script could import them, was rejected as
 * a worse trade than one small, clearly cross-referenced duplication in the
 * runner -- see that file's own `findIosDeviceOrThrow`.
