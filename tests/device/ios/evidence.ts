/**
 * Capture, from the leg that cannot use `shoot`.
 *
 * `tests/e2e/evidence.ts` reads `test.info()` for the project name and the
 * title, which only exists under Playwright. These journeys run under Vitest
 * and drive a real iPhone over WebDriver, so `shoot` is not merely
 * inconvenient here -- it is uncallable.
 *
 * #189 AC11 is why this exists: the reported clipping case has to be confirmed
 * on a real phone, and an operator can only judge it by seeing it. The desktop
 * suite has to STUB the refused fullscreen grant (`addInitScript`); the phone
 * refuses natively, which is the whole point of asking for one.
 *
 * Two properties copied deliberately from `shoot`, because they are what make
 * the evidence worth anything:
 *
 * 1. **Captured DURING the run, never retrofitted**, and called AFTER the
 *    assertion it documents -- so the existence of the image is itself the
 *    result. Vitest stops a test at the first failed `expect`, exactly as
 *    Playwright does, so a missing shot is a failed or unreached assertion.
 * 2. **Free when not wanted.** Gated on `EVIDENCE_DIR`. A screenshot is a
 *    round trip to a physical device, so an ordinary gauntlet must not pay for
 *    captures nobody asked for.
 *
 * The format is PNG, not the JPEG every other leg writes: WebDriver returns
 * base64 PNG and re-encoding would mean a new dependency, which is an operator
 * decision. Nothing downstream cares -- `mediaType` in the page builder sniffs
 * MAGIC BYTES rather than the extension, and throws on anything it cannot
 * recognise instead of emitting a src the browser cannot paint. That seam is
 * asserted in `tests/unit/device-evidence.test.ts` against this leg's own
 * bytes, because neither side proves it alone.
 */

/**
 * The only thing a capture needs from a driver.
 *
 * Structural, not `WebDriver`, so the unit test can prove the counter, the
 * paths and the manifest row without a phone in the room -- and so that "did
 * not capture" is provable by a driver that counts its own calls.

 * offers no such option: `GET /screenshot` returns the full device-pixel
 * buffer, 1260x2736 on this phone at ~400KB a shot. Thirty of those is 12MB,
 * and the page builder REFUSED to write the evidence page at 23.48MB against
 * the 16MB one published document may carry.
 *
 * Trimming captures would have bought the same bytes by deleting evidence.

 * iPhone on USB, neither of which exists anywhere else. Node has no image
 * resize of its own, and adding one would be an operator decision.
 *
 * DEGRADES, never fails: a capture at the wrong scale is still evidence, while
 * a journey that threw here would lose the assertion it was documenting. The
