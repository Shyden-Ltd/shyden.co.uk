 * driving Android Chrome. On attach it sends `Browser.setDownloadBehavior` pointing downloads at
 * a temp folder on the MAC, and skips that only for a browser it recognises as `clank`, the name
 * its own `_android` driver gives Android Chrome. The phone was being told to save into a folder
 * that does not exist on it: measured on 2026-09-22, every export in the phone run ended
 * `canceled` with 0 bytes while its tests passed, because they only checked the filename.
 *
 * The same probe measured the way out: Android Chrome honours a downloadPath ON THE PHONE and
 * creates the folder, and its own default behaviour saves the whole file too, so the product was
 * never at fault.
