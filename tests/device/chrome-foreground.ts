/**
 * Chrome losing foreground mid-run: observed live, at least twice, independently, across this
 * real-device harness's own history -- 147 failed and 62 failed in otherwise-clean runs, versus
 * the usual ~6. `adb shell dumpsys window` showed `com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox`
 * (the phone's configured default assistant -- `adb shell settings get secure assistant`) had
 * taken foreground; pending, unread notifications from that same package (a weather briefing)
 * were present in the notification shade when this was investigated, though
 * `fullscreenIntent=null` on both rules out the most common direct "notification self-launches
 * an activity" mechanism, so the exact trigger remains unconfirmed (screen-sleep and
 * `stay_on_while_plugged_in` were both measured and ruled out -- see
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-08-real-device-test-harness-design.md for the harness this
 * module is part of).
 *
 * `tests/device/android-preflight.setup.ts`'s own precondition 3 ("Chrome is launched and is
 * the foreground app") only runs ONCE, at the very start of a run -- nothing re-checked it
 * during the ~150s that follow. This module is the fix: a cheap (median ~68ms, measured)
 * re-usable check, called once per test by tests/e2e/fixtures.ts's `page` fixture, BEFORE that
 * test's own actions begin, with one bounded recovery attempt.
 *
 * android-preflight.setup.ts's preconditions 3 and 4 read the same two signals and import them
 * from here, so each check has one home. The focus check was once a cross-referenced duplicate
 * in the preflight ("both call sites need updating together"); #307 was the change that needed
 * both at once. On a cold launch Chrome takes the foreground about 200ms BEFORE its DevTools
 * socket exists (measured 3 of 3), so waiting for focus is not waiting for a Chrome that CDP
 * can reach, and both places that launch Chrome now wait for both.

/**

 * call (median ~68ms) and returns immediately. If something else has taken it, this is

 * one-line warning easy to scroll past) exactly what was found instead, attempts ONE bounded
 * recovery, and either succeeds (this test proceeds against a freshly-confirmed-foreground
 * Chrome, exactly as if the interruption never happened) or throws a clearly-named error that
 * fails THIS test with the real cause stated outright.
 *
 * Deliberately a PRE-check only (before the test's own actions, not also after): a post-check
 * cannot retroactively change a test's already-recorded verdict, so its only added value is
 * shrinking the window before the NEXT test's own pre-check would catch the same loss anyway --
 * judged not worth doubling this guard's already-nonzero per-test cost for. What this design
 * guarantees: no test ever KNOWINGLY starts against the wrong foreground app. What it does NOT
 * guarantee: if focus is stolen DURING a test's own execution (after its pre-check already
 * passed), that one test's own result is not specially flagged -- but the blast radius is
 * bounded to that single test, because the VERY NEXT test's pre-check catches it before any
 * further test can run against the wrong app. This is what turns an unbounded cascade (147
 * failures) into, at worst, one confusing result per genuine interruption, and turns a
 * PERSISTENT interruption into every affected test failing with the SAME clearly-named cause --
 * trivially recognisable as one root cause, never mistaken for 147 unrelated product defects.
