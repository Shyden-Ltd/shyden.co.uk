/**
 * Runs before the `android-chrome` project (wired via `dependencies` in
 * playwright.device.config.ts) and establishes, then asserts, every precondition the real
 * device needs. Each precondition is its own test with a written-out failure message, so a
 * red run names its cause instead of surfacing as a generic downstream timeout -- see
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-08-real-device-test-harness-design.md ("Preconditions are
 * asserted, never assumed").
 *
 * These tests use no Playwright browser/context/page fixture: they talk to the device only
 * through `adb` and a plain HTTP request, because the thing being verified here is whether a
 * browser can be reached at all.
 *
 * Serial mode: order matters (Brave must be stopped before Chrome is asserted foreground;
 * the tunnels must be mapped before the CDP endpoint is asked to answer), and there is no
 * value in running precondition 4 once precondition 1 has already shown there is no device to
 * ask.
