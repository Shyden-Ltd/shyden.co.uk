/**
 * Both tripwires retired.
 *
 * This file held two deliberate failures, each guarding a user-facing
 * behaviour that was still binary after #21 generalised the routing:
 *
 *   1. RETIRED by Stage 2. `strings.language.switchTo` was a single string
 *      meaning "the other language". Over two alternatives it labelled both
 *      identically — the visitor saw one word twice and could not tell which
 *      was which. The switcher is now a `<details>` dropdown that reads each
 *      language's own name from LOCALE_METADATA, so it labels N alternatives
 *      correctly. The guards below are what stop the single label returning.
 *
 *   2. RETIRED by Stage 3. The classroom-groups handover took
 *      `otherLocales(locale)[0]` — only ever right while there is exactly
 *      one alternative, and a silent choice on the teacher's behalf as soon
 *      as there are two. It is now a disclosure of one button per language,
 *      and the confirmation names the language it opened.
 *
 * Neither was retired by relaxing a number. Each was retired by building the
 * thing and replacing the tripwire with assertions about what was built —
 * which is the only way a tripwire may ever be removed from this file.

/**
 * A component's source with its comments removed, BOTH syntaxes.
 *
 * An `.astro` file is TypeScript frontmatter plus markup, and either kind of
 * comment can name the very thing a guard below looks for — `otherLocales(`,
 * `<LanguageSwitcher`, `<details`. Unstripped, this file's own explanatory
 * prose satisfies the presence assertions after the code they describe has
 * gone, and falsely reddens the absence ones beside them (#98).
 *
 * Stripped HERE rather than at each call site: two of the six already wrote
 * `withoutTsComments(source(IO))` by hand and the other four did not, which
 * is how the gap opened. Measured before trusting it in this medium — all
 * six asserted tokens survive, and neither component contains a URL, so the
 * `https://`-as-line-comment hazard does not arise.
