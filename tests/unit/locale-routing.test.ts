/**
 * Locale routing works for every locale in LOCALES, not just the two we ship.
 *
 * `localisePath` and `localeFromPath` were written when `id` was the only
 * prefixed locale, and both hardcode that literal: the strip is
 * `/^\/id(?=\/|$)/` and the match is `/^\/id(\/|$)/`. Neither is a bug while
 * LOCALES has two entries. Both become bugs the moment it has three, and they
 * fail QUIETLY — `localisePath('/zh/glory-points', 'en')` hands back
 * `/zh/glory-points` unchanged, so the English link on a Chinese page points at
 * the Chinese page and every test that only ever passes `id` still goes green.
 *
 * That is why every case below is DERIVED from LOCALES. A hand-written list of
 * locales would have to be extended by the same person who forgot to
 * generalise the helper — which is precisely the person these tests exist to
 * catch. #22 adds zh, vi and th; nothing in this file should need editing.
 *
 * The route layout is the contract these assert against: English is unprefixed
 * and lives at `/`, every other locale lives under `/<code>`. That is stated
 * once here and mirrored from `src/pages/`.
