/**
 * The sitemap's locale map, which cannot import the table it must agree with.
 *
 * `@astrojs/sitemap` reads its OWN i18n option, and `astro.config.mjs` runs
 * under plain Node and cannot import `src/lib/i18n`. So the list is written
 * out a second time -- and that duplication is exactly what went wrong: it
 * said en+id for weeks after #22 shipped five languages, so nine of fifteen
 * URLs declared no `xhtml:link` alternates at all. The e2e guard that should
 * have caught it named the same two locales by hand and passed. **Two
 * hand-written lists agreeing with each other is not a check.**
 *
 * The import cannot be fixed, so the SEAM is asserted instead -- the pattern
 * `pipeline-wiring.test.ts` already uses for workflow files.
 *
 * READ OVER COMMENT-STRIPPED SOURCE, and that is not a formality here: the
 * config's own comment above the map explains what the values are, and this
 * file's docblock names several. A guard matched against raw text would be
 * satisfied by documentation while the config said something else -- the #23
 * defect, which has now shipped in four repos. Mutation-verified below by
 * commenting the real entry out and watching it stay red.
