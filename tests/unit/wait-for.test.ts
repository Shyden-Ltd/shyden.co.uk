/**
 * `waitFor` treats a thrown predicate as "not yet" and polls again (#309).
 *
 * That is right for a transient failure, such as a `fetch` refused because a
 * server is still starting, and wrong for a terminal one: a `safaridriver`
 * that had already exited will never answer, yet its exit was re-thrown and
 * swallowed on every poll until the 15 s timeout, and only then reported.
 *
 * A caller now says which thrown errors are worth another poll. Anything else
 * ends the wait at once, rejecting with the very error the predicate threw.
