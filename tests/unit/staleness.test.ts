/**
 * Every assertion below compares against a LITERAL string, never against
 * `en.staleMode`/`id.staleMode` themselves.
 *
 * The first version of this file compared `staleReason(...)` to
 * `en.staleXxx` directly, the same way a careless copy of sections.test.ts's
 * OWN pattern would look right at a glance. Run before those keys existed in
 * en.ts, twelve of these thirteen tests passed anyway: `t.staleMode` reads
 * `undefined` off an object with no such key, `en.staleMode` reads the SAME
 * `undefined` off the same object, and `undefined === undefined` is true --
 * so the test could not have told a missing key from a correct one. Only
 * the Indonesian "not the English string" check caught it, because that one
 * assertion needed the two sides to DIFFER. Every other test here was
 * rewritten to a literal the moment this was noticed, mid-RED-phase, before
 * en.ts/id.ts were ever touched -- literals are what sections.test.ts itself
 * already does ('none added', not `en.stateNoneAdded`), and this file now
 * matches that, not the shortcut that slipped past on the first pass.
