/**
 * `scripts/` where a contributor's checkout might put it (#221).
 *
 * A script that decides "was I run directly?" by comparing paths answers
 * wrongly for some checkouts, and says nothing when it does: `main()` never
 * runs and the process exits 0. `import.meta.url` is percent-encoded while
 * `process.argv[1]` is not, so a space in the path defeats one spelling; Node
 * resolves symlinks in the URL but not in `argv[1]`, which defeats another.
 *
 * `spaced` is a REAL directory whose path holds a space. `linked` reaches the
 * same files through a symlink whose own name holds none, so a failure there
 * belongs to the symlink alone. The temp base is resolved first because
 * macOS's `tmpdir()` is itself behind a symlink (`/var` is `/private/var`):
 * unresolved, every run on a Mac would go through one, and the two cases would
 * blur into each other on one platform and not on the other.
 *
 * `node_modules` is linked in beside the copy, so a script that resolves a
 * package from its own location (`visual.mjs` does, at load) finds the
 * checkout's packages, as it would in a real checkout. `remove` unlinks that
 * link without following it; Node's `rmSync` never follows symlinks.
