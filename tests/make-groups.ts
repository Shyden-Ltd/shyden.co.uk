/**
 * Deal `count` students into groups of `size`, with the animation skipped.
 *
 * The one journey every suite that touches the Classroom Group Creator
 * performs, and it had four bodies before #277: a file-local helper in
 * `classroom-groups-controls.spec.ts` and three inline copies, in
 * `classroom-groups-privacy.spec.ts`, `dev-sanity.spec.ts` and
 * `prod-sanity.spec.ts`. Two of those are the gates: `dev-verified`, which
 * `main`'s branch protection requires, and `prod-verified`.
 *
 * They were not equivalent. The helper opens `#cg-sound-body` only when it
 * is hidden; the three copies click `#cg-sound-toggle` unconditionally, so
 * any of them running against an already-open section would CLOSE it and
 * then fail on a `selectOption` for a control nobody can see. None does
 * today -- each goes to a fresh page first -- which is exactly the shape of
 * a bug that waits for the test around it to grow one more step.
 *
 * `site-pages.ts` records the same lesson from the other direction: the dev
 * and prod sanity suites once carried byte-identical hand-written path
 * tables, `sitePaths()` grew to four, and both gates went on testing three.
 * Two gates are worth having because they fail independently; they are not
 * worth having in two dialects that drift apart.
