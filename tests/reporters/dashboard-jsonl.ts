 * the two environment variables, the `writeFailed` latch, the truncate, the
 * append, and the one-time notice — differing only in the name each put in
 * front of its error message (#277). Two copies of "the dashboard must never
 * be able to fail a test run" is two places for that promise to stop being
 * true, and neither copy was reachable from a test: both are instantiated by
 * a test runner, so nothing in this repo had ever exercised the failure path
 * they exist for. Here it is a plain object, and `dashboard-jsonl.test.ts`
