/**
 * How long each individual NAVIGATION took, per project. #44.
 *
 * `e2e-timings.test.ts` already keeps the whole-test durations the run was
 * throwing away, and `playwright.config.ts` records what they settled and what
 * they could not: they "bound the problem, they do not separate a slow
 * navigation from a slow test around one". `page.goto: Test timeout of 30000ms
 * exceeded` names the TEST budget, so a 900ms navigation inside a 29s test and
 * a 29s navigation produce the identical line -- and call for opposite fixes.
 * This reporter is what tells them apart, and it keeps the numbers for every
 * run rather than only for the run that fails.
 *
 * WHY A REPORTER AND NOT ANOTHER READ OF THE JSON REPORT. Measured, Playwright
 * 1.63.0: the built-in `json` reporter -- the file `scripts/test-e2e.mjs`
 * already writes and parses -- STRIPS every `pw:api` step and keeps only the
 * user's `test.step` entries, with no `category` field on them at all. A probe
 * run whose test made two navigations, one of them inside a `test.step`,
 * produced a report containing the `test.step` and NEITHER navigation. The
 * durations exist only in the in-memory tree a reporter is handed.
 *
 * This adds no dependency, no artifact upload and no third-party action to
 * SHA-pin: it is a file in this repo, appended to the reporter list the runner
 * already merges, writing to a temp file the runner already deletes. Keeping
 * the supply chain of this pipeline small is the point of #23 and #39, and it
 * survives this change intact.
