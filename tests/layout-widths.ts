/**
 * The widths at which a page's layout can change, read from the media queries
 * its stylesheets declare (#329).
 *
 * Within one layout a row's items keep their size while the row widens, so a
 * row is tightest at the lower edge of each range. Measuring both sides of
 * every breakpoint is what lets a handful of widths stand for every width from
 * NARROWEST up, and it only works if both sides are really on different sides.
 *
 * Viewports are whole pixels, so the two widths are the last whole pixel on
 * which a condition has one answer and the first on which it has the other.
 * Which pixels those are depends on the comparison: `width >= 720px` first
 * holds at 720, `width > 720px` at 721. A condition and its complement change
 * at the same pixel (`>=` with `<`, `>` with `<=`), which is why two formulas
 * cover all four.
 *
 * Every spelling is read, because the served CSS is the minifier's rather than
 * ours: it writes `min-width: 720px` as `width>=720px`, and nothing stops a
 * stylesheet using the range syntax with a strict comparison, value first, or
 * as a two-sided range like `480px <= width < 720px`.
