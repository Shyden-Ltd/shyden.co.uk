 * fixture: the page's unit tests, its browser tests and the pre-merge check's
 * tests all sign off the same page.
 *
 * The manifest and the report spell each journey the same way, as the builder
 * requires since #263. A prefix on one side alone renders every journey
 * twice, once with its capture and once without, which the browser fixture
 * did, unnoticed, until #197 counted its journeys.
