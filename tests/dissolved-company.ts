/**
 * The dissolved company, in every form a page once printed it (#370; the
 * operator, 2026-09-27: the footer names no company, no number and no
 * registered office, in any language).
 *
 * ONE list. `chrome.spec.ts` (the footer, per locale) and
 * `copy-reaches-a-page.spec.ts` (every built page) each kept their own, they
 * had drifted ('Perusahaan' in one, 'Perusahaan baru' in the other), and
 * neither held a single Chinese, Vietnamese or Thai registration sentence:
 * both were written from the English and Indonesian copy (#390 F116). Each
 * entry is taken from what `494836b^` actually printed, and
 * `tests/unit/dissolved-company.test.ts` pins every one of those strings.
 *
 * Phrases, not bare words, because the all-pages scan reads five languages
 * of live copy, where `Registered` or `Perusahaan` alone can be ordinary
 * prose. `Ltd` is the one bare word, matched as a word.
