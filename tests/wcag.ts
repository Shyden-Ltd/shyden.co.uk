/**
 * WCAG relative luminance and contrast, in one place.
 *
 * The formula had FIVE copies before #277: `contrast.test.ts` and
 * `print-legibility.spec.ts` at the top level, and three more inside
 * `page.evaluate()` callbacks where a top-level scan could not see them. The
 * two groups did not agree — the node copies linearised at `0.04045` and the
 * browser copies at `0.03928` — which is exactly the disagreement
 * `contrastRatio`'s own docblock predicted when it was written: "two contrast
 * computations that differ by one term would disagree about the same pixels,
 * and the suite that got the lenient one would pass while the page failed a
 * real audit."
 *
 * `0.04045` is the value kept: it is what sRGB and WCAG 2.1/2.2 state, where
 * `0.03928` is WCAG 2.0's published text. Measured rather than assumed, and
 * pinned in `wcag.test.ts`: for an 8-bit colour the two CANNOT disagree. The
 * thresholds straddle channel values 10.0164 to 10.3148, and `v / 255` for
 * an integer `v` never lands there — 10/255 is 0.0392, 11/255 is 0.0431. So
 * the five copies differed in text and could not have differed in result,
 * which is the kind of drift that survives review: nothing goes red, and the
 * next edit to one of them is the one that matters.
 *
 * A browser cannot import this: `page.evaluate` serialises its callback. The
 * answer is not a sixth copy — it is that a browser callback READS (computed
 * colour, background, opacity) and the arithmetic happens here. See
 * `contrastRatio` in `tests/e2e/helpers.ts`.
