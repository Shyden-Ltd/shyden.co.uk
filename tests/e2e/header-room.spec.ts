/**
 * The header row has room for everything in it, in every locale (#329).
 *
 * At 320px in Indonesian the Shyden wordmark ran 13px under the menu button.
 * The language switcher needed 184px for "Bahasa Indonesia", so the row's
 * three items needed 302px of the 288px inside the gutters, and flex squeezed
 * the wordmark's box below the width of its own text. Nothing could see it:
 * text assertions read text, which was all there, and the no-horizontal-scroll
 * tests read the document's `scrollWidth`, which never moved because the
 * overlap happened INSIDE the header. Only geometry sees this -- every item's
 * box, and the range its text paints, against every other item's.
 *
 * Nothing is listed by hand. The pages come from the built sitemap, the widths
 * from the breakpoints the served CSS declares, and the items from the controls
 * the bar renders at that width, so #142's theme switch is measured the day it
 * exists.
