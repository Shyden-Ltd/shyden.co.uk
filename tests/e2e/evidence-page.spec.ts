/**
 * The evidence page's sign-off ticks, driven through the page's OWN rendered
 * script in a real browser (#172).
 *
 * The page kept the runtime's frozen snapshot as its own state, so after the
 * first save every tick was silently dropped and repainted unticked, while
 * the status line said "Saved." #136's sign-off kept 2 of its 5 ticks that
 * way, and #17's page had reported the same symptom three days earlier.
 * Nothing had ever run the script: the unit suite reads the page as text, and
 * text cannot freeze an object.
 *
 * Every behaviour runs against both orders a write can complete in (see
 * `db-stand-in.ts`), and a store slower than the page's save window is
 * played out step by step, the test releasing each completion itself
 * (#260). Ticks are found through their journey's HEADING, never
 * through the checkbox's own name, so these tests fail on the tick they name
 * and not on the naming defect #172 also fixes.
