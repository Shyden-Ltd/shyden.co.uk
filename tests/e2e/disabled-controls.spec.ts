/**
 * What a disabled control looks like and what it affords (#250).
 *
 * This file replaces `disabled-affordance-probe.spec.ts`, whose own docblock
 * said to delete it once AC7 had a real guard. Its measurement is recorded
 * durably on the ticket (issues/250#issuecomment-5753008996) and on PR #258;
 * the two facts that shape everything here are:
 *
 *  - **#250's stated premise is FALSE.** A disabled control DOES receive
 *    hover on all five engines — `hitRelation=self`, `mouseover=true`, 11/11
 *    everywhere, `<button>` included (CI run 35523913132, 55 readings, zero
 *    invalid). No wrapper is needed to carry the cursor.
 *  - **Nine of eleven disabled controls had no cursor treatment at all.**
 *    The lone `cursor: not-allowed` in the repo was scoped to
 *    `.switch input:disabled`, so only the two sex switches showed it.
 *
 * Three things about HOW this measures, each of which a weaker guard gets
 * wrong and stays green for:
 *
 *  - It asserts the POSITIVE cursor value, never `not.toBe('default')`.
 *    WebKit and mobile-Safari report an unstyled cursor as `auto`, Chromium
 *    and Firefox as `default`, so a negative assertion passes on two engines
 *    for free — the precise shape of a guard that is green for the wrong
 *    reason.
 *  - It reads the computed cursor of the element that WINS the hit test at
 *    the pointer's own position, not of the control. `cursor` is inherited,
 *    and what the user sees is what the hit element declares. AC7 says
 *    "proven on a real render ... not by the presence of a CSS rule".
 *  - The fill it requires is RESOLVED from `--disabled-fill` off `:root` at
 *    runtime and compared in computed rgb, the `palette-controls.spec.ts`
 *    idiom: retune the token and this follows, but a control painted some
 *    other grey still fails.
 *
 * The population is derived from the DOM in every scenario (AC1), never
 * hand-listed: this repo shipped 74px of horizontal scroll because the one
 * section nobody added to a hand-written list was the one that broke.
