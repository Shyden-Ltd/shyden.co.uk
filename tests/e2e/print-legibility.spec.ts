 * forces backgrounds transparent — correctly, so a dark page does not print as
 * a slab of toner — and never reset the ink, because on the old light ground
 * it never had to. Measured under emulated print media, every element on
 * /classroom-groups computed to rgb(234 242 255) on white paper: a teacher
 * would have printed a BLANK sheet of groups.
 *
 * No existing guard could see it. The screen palette was correct and fully
 * asserted; the unit contrast suite reads tokens.css's `:root`, which is the
 * SCREEN block; and a screenshot is taken in screen media. The defect lives
 * only in a medium nothing rendered.
 *
 * Measured against WHITE and nothing else. Paper is white, whatever the page
 * declares, and `print-color-adjust` is honoured inconsistently — so a guard
 * that judged the ink against the page's own background would confirm a
 * legible pair that never reaches the sheet.
