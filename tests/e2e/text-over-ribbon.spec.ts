/**
 * Every piece of text the aurora ribbon sits behind clears WCAG AA, measured
 * on the rendered page (#371).
 *
 * `contrast.test.ts` scores the atmosphere by stacking every layer at full
 * strength under one letter. The ribbon's three fields are separate soft
 * ellipses that never meet at one point, so that model failed the ribbon at
 * 2.76:1, a stack no page paints. The operator chose, 2026-09-27, to measure
 * real text instead: this renders each built page, hides its text,
 * photographs the ground, and holds every text run the ribbon reaches to
 * 4.5:1 against the pixels behind its own line boxes. Each run annotates the
 * tightest text it found.
 *
 * 4.5:1 for every run, headings included: the large-text allowance would be
 * a second rule to get right, and no heading here needs it.

 * an OPAQUE fill colour of an ancestor (a card, a button) is skipped: the
 * ribbon cannot show through it, and `contrast.test.ts` already scores that

 * scored, and so is text over a background image, against its real pixels.
 *
 * The browser only reads: the runs, then every colour in the photograph
 * behind each one. The arithmetic happens here in node, against the one copy
 * of the WCAG formula (`tests/wcag.ts`, #277). An `evaluate` callback cannot
 * import, so one that did the maths would be a second copy, and this spec's
 * first version was one, linearising at its own constant.
