 * The locales a WIDGET-BEHAVIOUR test runs against, and why it is a sample.
 *
 * These specs assert what a control does — a button toggles, a field
 * validates, a dialog traps focus. That markup is one component rendered
 * through the `[locale]` route, and the assertions are not layout- or
 * text-sensitive, so running them across all five locales would add roughly
 * 250 tests to catch nothing.
 *
 * Anything layout- or text-sensitive must NOT use this: it belongs on the
 * full `LOCALES` set, because character widths differ. `language-switcher`'s
 * 320px overflow test and `thai-typography` are the examples.
 *
 * This exists because the literal it replaces (`['/x', '/id/x']`) was not a
 * decision — it was written when `LOCALES` was `en`+`id` and simply never
 * revisited when #22 shipped five (#75). Sampling is a legitimate choice;
 * inheriting one by accident is not. Widen here if that changes.
