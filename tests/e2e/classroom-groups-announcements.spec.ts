/**
 * A live region only reports mutations to something already in the
 * accessibility tree. `hidden` takes an element out of that tree, so writing
 * the text and revealing the element afterwards mutates nothing anyone is
 * listening to — NVDA, JAWS and VoiceOver commonly say nothing at all when a
 * region appears already-populated. The visitor presses the button and hears
 * silence, whether it worked or not.
 *
 * That ordering is invisible in the finished DOM: both sequences end in the
 * same state. So these tests record the operations as the page performs them.
 *
 * Recorded by wrapping the real accessors and calling them, so the page
 * behaves exactly as it ships: `hidden` on each region itself, and every
 * write that lands INSIDE a live region, credited to the nearest one. The
 * obvious alternative, a MutationObserver, is not usable here: its callback
 * is a microtask that runs after every synchronous mutation in the batch, so
 * reading `hidden` inside it reports the END state for every record and a
 * reversed order looks identical. That version of this test passed against
 * the defect it was written for.
